</h2>

<hr class="decor">

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Towards</span> the close of the
year 1837 I undertook, at the request of a friend, a journey into
the most distant portion of the countries under the government of
the Viceroy of Egypt, in order to collect information referring to
commerce, but more especially with the view of convincing myself
whether trade might be carried on with these countries directly,
instead of through the intermediation of agents, in whose hands it
had hitherto rested. The task, although rather arduous, was not
displeasing to me, for a residence of several years in Egypt had
rendered me tolerably proficient in the Arabic language and
colloquial dialect, and my prior travels in various parts of the
Soudan had made me familiar with the habits of the natives,
besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> procuring me
the acquaintance of many merchants from the more distant provinces.
With these advantages I travelled during nineteen months in all
directions through these countries. Whilst on my journey, or
sojourning in any place, I noted down in my journal everything that
appeared to me remarkable, which I laid before my friends for their
amusement on my return. It is with their advice, and more
particularly at the instigation of the celebrated French traveller
<em>Antoine d’Abbadie</em>, that the information I was able to
collect respecting a country of which so little was formerly known,
now appears in print. My journey was strictly mercantile in its
tendency; I cannot, therefore, venture on so explicit a description
as might be expected of a traveller or a man well versed in the
various sciences a traveller should profess, and yet I am not
altogether diffident, inasmuch as I think that my small
contribution will at least form a short guide for those who may be
willing to explore these countries more fully hereafter, as it will
give them many a hint before they reach these climes, which will
save them much trouble and inconvenience during their residence in
Kordofan. Although two distinguished German travellers,
<em>Dr.</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
<em>Rueppel</em> and the <em>Conseillier des Mines, Russegger</em>,
have visited the country before me, their sojourn there was of such
short duration, and they travelled in so much company, that many
things must have escaped their observation, and remained hidden
from them, which were revealed to me, who, defying every species of
danger, wandered through the province alone, under a variety of
circumstances, sometimes accompanied by one solitary servant, and
sometimes even without thus much protection. Thus I have often
shared the humble fare of a camel-driver in the desert, or
conversed with the natives in their damp and obscure Tukkoli;
whilst at other times I have enjoyed the opportunity of gaining
information from the governor and higher officials, to whose feasts
I was frequently invited.</p>

<p>My readers must excuse me if, in the perusal of this small work,
they meet with a deficiency of much information generally expected
from a traveller, for I repeat again that I did not undertake this
journey with the view of writing, but that I wrote merely at the
request of my friends, and because I thought that by lifting the
veil of obscurity from certain relations, I might in some measure
become useful to futurity, and in this respect I<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span> have already met with a few
grateful acknowledgments. I shall, therefore, send this little book
into the world with confidence, assured that it will find a
considerate reception, and that its deficiencies will be placed to
the account of the circumstances under which it was produced.</p>

</h2>

<hr class="decor">

<p><span class="sc">Ignatius Pallme</span>, a Bohemian by birth, it
would appear, undertook the journey to Kordofan, on commission, for
a mercantile establishment at Cairo, in the hope of discovering new
channels of traffic with Central Africa. In the pursuit of his
object, he sojourned longer in the country than any European before
him; the information he furnishes respecting the present state of
this province of Egypt in particular, and of the Belled Soudan in
general, may, therefore, be considered the most authentic in
existence at the present time. That few travellers have visited
these countries, and subjected the information they were enabled to
collect to print, may be deduced from the facts, that scarcely
one-half of the places mentioned in the work before us are to be
found on the most recent maps; and that in referring to the
literature on these countries, for making a comparison between
Pallme’s opinions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span> and
those of other authors, many difficulties were experienced, and
many researches proved ungratified. The original is characterised
by an ingenuous and unassuming style; and it has been my chief
endeavour to paraphrase the text as closely as compatible with the
two languages. Those idiomatic constructions which may be met with
in the translation, are owing to this strict adherence to the
original; but I have at least the consolation of knowing that the
loss by solecism may be considered as gain in authenticity—the
chief object of the undertaking. Pallme’s orthography has been
generally followed as regards Arab terms, excepting where the same
words are familiar to the public in a different garb, or where they
are to be found otherwise spelt, in at least two accredited English
authors; for it was impossible to furnish the certain literation,
as the Arab character is not affixed to the original text.</p>

<span class="med">POSITION OF THE COUNTRY BORDERS, RIVERS, SOIL,
AND CLIMATE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Kordofan</span>, one of the most southern
provinces under the government of the Viceroy of Egypt, extends in
the north from Haraza to Kodero, in the south from the Nuba
mountains, and eastwards from Caccia to the Shilluk or
Shillook<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> mountains, about four degrees of longitude. The
desert of Dongola forms its northern border, that of Darfûr its
western limit. Towards the south, no definite confines can be
described, as the extent of these dominions increases or decreases
accordingly as the inhabitants of this part of the country become
tributary, either by their own free-will, or are rendered subjects
by force, as occasionally occurs, and subsequently free themselves
from the yoke. On this account the present government has divided
the country into five districts, and regards Kodero, and the free
heathen Nuba, as its southern border.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_2">[2]</span> Kordofan has no townships on the Bahr-Abiad, or
White Nile, for the village nearest to this river is situate at a
distance of about four hours’ march from its banks. The Nomadic
tribes, inhabiting the western shore, belong to the realms of
Sennaar, and are entirely distinct from the natives of Kordofan;
the Bakara-Kubbabeesh<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> only, a Nomadic tribe, also, frequently
drive their herds to the borders of the White River for pasturage.
The five districts are named severally: Korci, Bara, Ketshmar,
Abou-Haraz, and Dayara. Each of them is governed by a Casheff, or
captain of the district, who is at the same time captain in a
regiment of the line. Taking a general view of Kordofan, it may be
said to consist chiefly of a cluster of small and large oases,
which are not far distant from each other, as in the Great Desert.
The soil is sandy throughout, and the country is rather flat than
mountainous. In the vicinity of Haraza, however, a chain of
mountains arises, shelving off towards the White River; while the
mountains in the interior are inconsiderable, several of which may
be seen towards the south and south-east. The soil is, on the
whole, very fertile; for, with the commencement of the rainy
season, vegetation springs up from the earth as if by magic, and
nature then shows herself in her full vigour and pomp; balsamic
odours, which act almost intoxicatingly on the senses, are
everywhere breathed forth, and the traveller might
imagine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> himself
transplanted into the fairy gardens of the Arabian Nights’
tales.</p>

<p>Kordofan has no flowing rivers; during the rainy season, some
few running streams are formed, but these dry up as quickly as they
appear. There are several lakes, or large ponds, in the country,
amongst which those at Arat, Birget,<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Ketshmar, and Caccia, are
the most considerable; in the latter, many leeches are found; but
the other stagnant waters, which are generated during the rainy
season, quickly evaporate, and only those above-named contain water
throughout the year. In the vicinity of Haraza, in a north-easterly
direction from the village, pure and fresh water for drinking is
found on the summit of a mountain during the whole year. There is
an abundance of iron ore in the province, respecting which more
explicit information may be gleaned from the work of Russegger, the
Royal Imperial inspector of mines, who, in the year 1837, travelled
through this country as far as Sheibon, to which book I must refer
my readers, as geognostic research was not the purpose of my
travels. The climate is very unhealthy, especially during the rainy
season; no hut is then, indeed, to be met with in which there are
not at least several sick; in the dry season, again, all disease
disappears; at this time, however, not only man, but all living
creatures, suffer from the extreme heat. The eye then rests with
melancholy on the desolate and parched plains,—<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> trophies of the victory of the
heat over animated nature,—where nothing is to be seen but bones of
men and animals bleached by the burning sun. During the whole of
this season, which endures about eight months, the sky is clear and
cloudless, and the heat is insupportable, especially in the months
of April and May. From eleven o’clock, <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span>, to three, <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, when
the thermometer stands in the shade at 38°, or even at 40°, Reaumur
(117° to 122° Fahrenheit), it is impossible for any breathing
creature to remain in the open air. Every living being, both men
and cattle, with equal eagerness seek the shade, to protect
themselves from the scorching rays of a fierce sun. Man sits during
these hours as if in a vapour-bath, his cheerfulness of disposition
declines, and he is almost incapable of thought; listless, and with
absence of mind, he stares vacantly before him, searching in vain
for a cool spot. The air breathed is hot as if it proceeded from a
heated furnace, and acts in so enervating a manner on the animal
economy, that it becomes a trouble even to move a limb. All
business ceases, everything is wrapped in a sleep of death, until
the sun gradually sinks, and the cool air recalls men and animals
again into life and activity. The nights, on the other hand, are so
sharp, that it is necessary to be more careful in guarding against
the effects of cold in this country, than in the northern parts of
Europe during the severest winter, for the consequences frequently
prove fatal. During the whole year, day and night<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> are equally divided, or with but
imperceptible variation, and, as in all tropical climates, there is
no twilight; for with sunset night begins. During the dry season,
everything in nature appears desolate and dismal; the plants are
burnt up; the trees lose their leaves, and appear like brooms; no
bird is heard to sing; no animal delights to disport in the
gladness of its existence; every living being creeps towards the
forest to secrete itself, seeking shelter from the fearful heat;
save that, now and then, an ostrich will be seen traversing the
desert fields in flying pace, or a giraffe hastening from one oasis
to another. In this season, however, frightful hurricanes
occasionally arise, and fill the minds of those, who have not been
witness of such a phenomenon in nature before, with the utmost
consternation. A powerful current of air, of suffocating heat,
blows fiercely from one point of the heavens to the other,
devastating everything that lies in its course. The atmosphere
bears at these times generally a leaden grey appearance, and is
impregnated with fine sand: the sun loses its brilliancy, and total
darkness envelopes the earth, rendering it even difficult to
distinguish objects at a few paces distant. The sky changes
suddenly, becomes of a yellow colour, then assumes a reddish hue,
and the sun appears as a blood-red disk. The wind howls, tears up
everything within its reach; houses, fences, and trees by the
roots, carrying them away with it; levels mounds of sand, and piles
up fresh hills. In short,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_6">[6]</span> the devastation caused by a hurricane of this
kind is beyond description. Unfortunate, indeed, is he who happens
to be overtaken in the desert by one of these storms. There is no
course left for him to save himself, but to throw himself with his
face on the ground, in order to avoid suffocation by the pressure
of the atmosphere. Respiration is totally impeded; all the fibres
are tightly contracted; the chest threatens to burst for want of
pure air; and a man of rather weak constitution, overtaken by one
of these hurricanes in the open air, generally succumbs. But robust
men, even those in full vigour of life, feel depressed in every
limb for several hours after exposure to these storms, and recover
but slowly, and by degrees. Animals fly and endeavour to conceal
themselves; every creature, in fact, seeks a place of shelter. The
camels on journeys indicate the storm before it breaks forth by an
unsteadiness of gait, and by drooping their heads towards the
ground.</p>

<p>A no less remarkable phenomenon is the Mirage, <i>i. e.</i> the
appearance of seas and rivers, supposed to be observed in the
middle of the desert, but which, in fact, are only represented to
the eye in this deceptive manner by a rising vapour, and the
reflection of the sun. The sensation is indescribable, of descrying
at the distance large rivers and lakes, after having travelled for
several tedious days through the desert, where nothing is to be
seen but sand and heaven, as but water and sky on the high
seas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> and at a time,
moreover, when the traveller is longing after water. We wish for
wings, to be able to reach the element of which we have been so
long deprived as quickly as possible. We delight in the idea of
invigorating the exhausted and enervated body by a bath, and the
eye is continually bent upon this pleasing object. But what is our
disappointment,—how are the spirits depressed,—when,
notwithstanding these ardent wishes, on our approach, the lakes and
rivers, which we had discerned at the distance, are resolved, in
the literal sense of the word, into thin air; and when we find, in
lieu of water, the sand as hot and dry as in the place we had just
left! When the traveller has frequently observed this phenomenon,
and accustomed himself to it, he will be pleased with the image
which diverts his eye, and will look upon it as a variation in the
scene. These aerial phenomena are called in the country,
Bahr-el-Ghazal, or Gazelle Rivers, probably because, like these
animals, they disappear as soon as seen.</p>

<p>The rains begin in the month of June, and terminate with the
month of October. Those who have not spent this season in a
tropical country, can form no idea of the showers which then drench
the earth. The storms generally arise in the east or in the south.
A small black cloud is, at first, perceived on the horizon, which
increases as it approaches, spreads in a few minutes, with
incredible velocity, over the whole region, and then descends. A
fearful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> storm now
rages: flash upon flash, and peal succeeding peal, the lightning
illumines the whole heavens, and the thunder rolls most fearfully,
as if the sky were about to open and the earth to burst; streams of
water pour down with violence, which the soil is incapable of
imbibing, and torrents are thus formed, destined, however, soon to
be lost in the sands. Showers of this description generally last
over one quarter of an hour, seldom for a longer period, and very
rarely, indeed, are they repeated on the same day. They remit
frequently during two, three, or even six days, and this is the
most unhealthy, and even dangerous time both for strangers and
natives; but it is admitted by general consent, that those of white
colour suffer more than the blacks.</p>

<p>As if by magic, Nature now awakes from her sleep of death; for,
immediately after the first shower, the earth is clad with verdure,
the trees shoot forth fresh buds, and a vesture of flowers is
spread over the whole country.</p>

<p>Certain districts of Kordofan, whose position is not elevated,
may, indeed, be compared with Paradise. Everything there appears in
most perfect luxuriance. All the trees and bushes are covered with
flowers and fruit, so that the leaves are scarcely discernible. The
grass attains a height sufficient to cover a rider and his horse.
Creeping plants wind themselves up to the summit of the highest
trees; in short, the force and vigour of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_9">[9]</span> vegetation is everywhere demonstrated. As the
eye is delighted by the diversity of the magnificent flowers, so it
is also gratified by the varieties of colours displayed in the
plumage of the parrots, colibris, and other feathered inhabitants
of the desert and the gardens, animating the trees with their
gorgeous plumes, and enchanting the ear with their delightful song;
melodious and charming notes resound, as if in emulation, from the
various branches, and I could almost have forgotten the song of the
lark and the nightingale of my own beloved country. But these
silvery notes are not of long duration; the song is too sweet to
last for a long time. It begins as the first dawn of morning
removes the veil of night, increases as the light extends; but when
the sun arises above the horizon of the desert, or gilds the
mountains with his rays, one warbler after the other becomes mute,
and single notes are only heard. Now appear a swarm of butterflies
and beautiful insects, delighting the eye with the same change of
gorgeous colours. Giraffes, antelopes, and other animals, browse
upon the plains in the full enjoyment of life. But all these charms
soon disappear, for, under the operation of the unhealthy climate,
all cheerfulness of spirits fades in opposition to the resolute
efforts of the will, and anxiety befalls man and robs him of all
his rest. Debility of stomach, nausea, disinclination for food, in
short, all the precursory symptoms of disease, deprive him of every
enjoyment which the beauties<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_10">[10]</span> of nature might afford; and, in a short time,
he is stretched upon the bed of sickness, from which no stranger is
entirely exempt; thus, of all the Europeans who have visited these
regions, and sojourned there for any time, but very few have
escaped with their lives, as far as our observations at present
reach; for the miasmata with which the air is impregnated, arising
from the morasses, the unwholesome water, the damp south winds,
penetrating to the very nerves, all co-operate to wear out the
thread of life; and every one hastens, if it be, indeed, in his
power, to quit this unhealthy climate as quickly as he possibly
can. Do not imagine that the showers clear the atmosphere, as is
the case in Europe, for they are immediately followed by intense
heat, which, during my residence in the country attained a degree
of 30° R. = 99° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>December and January are the most healthy months, but the nights
are then so cold that the thermometer frequently falls to 8°, or
even 4° R., (50° or 41° F.,) especially shortly before sunrise.
This rapid change from the extremes of heat and cold, and the
pernicious vapours, are very deleterious in their effect on the
constitution of man, especially on the health of strangers coming
from the northern districts of Egypt or from Europe; and, indeed,
few men can ever totally accommodate themselves to this
climate.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span><a id=
"c02"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="med">HISTORY.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Every</span> one will agree that it is no easy
matter to write the history of a country, or, rather, of a
province, whose inhabitants live in a state of utter ignorance, and
care little for the occurrences which took place but half the
period of the life of man before them. There exist, moreover, no
chronicles capable of giving information on any event which might
serve as reference; thus I was unable to extend my researches, or
to learn more than was communicated to me by a faquir,<a id=
"FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
seventy-eight years of age, who appeared to me worthy of belief,
and who had been an eye-witness of all the recent events.</p>

<p>Kordofan takes its name from a mountain, situate at three and a
half hours’ march to the south-east of Lobeid. The aborigines are
negroes from Nubia, who, even at the present time, inhabit many
parts of Kordofan. The word Kordofan itself is of Nubian
derivation. Three tribes subsequently immigrated: the Hadejat, el
Giomme, and Bederie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
The period of this immigration, however, cannot be definitely
determined. These three nomadic tribes distributed themselves over
the country round about Mount Kordofan, occupied themselves with
cattle-breeding, and each tribe had its sheikh, or magistrate; but
from these three tribes, collectively, a head was chosen, who acted
as impartial judge in all questions of difficulty, and, in fact, as
the last authority. This people became, towards the middle of the
last century, better acquainted with Sennaar. The King of Sennaar,
namely, sent, in the year 1779, the Sheikh Nacib, with two thousand
cavalry, to take possession of the country, and the tribes
surrendered, with a pretty good grace, to their fate, without
offering much resistance. Thus they remained for about five years,
under the government of Sennaar. A Melek was instituted, and the
people felt themselves happy under his government. Several Arab
tribes, and people from Sennaar and Dongola, immigrated into the
country, and agriculture and commerce began to flourish. Darfour
now directed its attention towards this province, and entered on a
campaign, in which the Melek-el-Hashma was driven out of Sennaar,
and expelled the country for ever. Meleks now governed this country
in the name of the Sultan of Darfour, up to the year 1821, during
thirty-five years of the reign of Mehemed Ibn Fadels. During this
epoch the country was also prosperous; the inhabitants lived in
peace, and were not troubled with taxes; the merchants were exempt
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> all duties, and
the tribute paid was a voluntary present to the Sultan of
Darfour.</p>

<p>Bara, the second commercial town of importance in the country,
was built by the Dongolavi; tribes immigrated from the most distant
parts, and this province enjoyed a high degree of prosperity, under
the really mild government of Darfour. Commerce extended in all
directions; caravans brought the produce from Abyssinia, the
interior of Africa, and from Egypt, into the two towns of Lobeid
and Bara, whence the greater part was again transported into other
countries. Abundance might be said to reign everywhere, and there
was no want of any necessaries, whilst all were wealthy, and even
the women of the less opulent inhabitants wore golden rings in
their noses and ears, and many even golden bracelets and silver
anklets round their feet. No other metal but gold or silver was to
be seen in the decoration of the women, and many female slaves even
wore gold about their persons. Agriculture and cattle-breeding
flourished, and there were few inhabitants in the country who did
not, to a certain extent, devote themselves to commerce. The whole
population, in fact, lived free from care, and was wealthy; singing
and dancing resounded from place to place; in short, this was the
golden age of Kordofan.</p>

<p>This state of happiness was not, however, of long duration, for
in the year 1821 Mehemed Ali sent his son-in-law, the notorious
Defturdar, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
brigade of four thousand five hundred infantry and cavalry,
attended by eight hundred Bedouins and eight pieces of artillery,
to subject this country to his power. The people, apprized of his
intention, prepared themselves to the utmost of their power for
defence. The Melek Moosalem marched out with his troops to meet the
Defturdar at Bara,—a march of twelve hours from Lobeid. His
numerous but irregular army was well provided with every species of
warlike weapons, excepting fire-arms, which were little or not at
all known in the country. The cavalry, like the old Numidian
equestrian troops, wore a shirt of mail, and pointed helmet without
a vizor on their heads, and bore a double-edged sword thirty-six
inches in length. The horses were caparisoned with plates of
copper. The infantry were nearly naked; armed simply with a shield
and spear, and but a small party of them with two-edged swords,
(<em>turbatsh</em>,) and a species of tomahawk. The battle was
fierce and bloody. The men of Kordofan rushed with fury upon the
foe, and defended their freedom with a total disregard of death;
even women participated in the fray. Hundreds of the combatants
fell struck by the balls of the enemy; the wounded placed their
fingers in their wounds, unable to understand how they could have
been hurt, without having been touched by a weapon; so ignorant
were they of the use of fire-arms. Infuriated they flung their
spears at the cannons; and, having succeeded in capturing a gun for
a short time, sought to revenge themselves on it for the
destruction it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> had
poured forth, by attacking it with their swords. The battle
remained for a long time undecided. The Defturdar placed himself at
the head of his cavalry, and, although ill, would not leave the
field. Several attacks were valiantly repulsed. The Bedouins put
the Turks to the blush by their bravery; where the battle raged
hottest, these children of the desert were to be seen discomfiting
the enemy most. Victory inclined sometimes to the side of the
Turks, sometimes to the side of the men of Kordofan, but it yet
remained doubtful. The Turks were sometimes sorely pushed; a
Sheikh, however, of the Bedouins, from the race of Gemeat, was
fortunate enough to lay Moosalem, the leader of the Kordofanese,
prostrate with a pistol shot; his death decided the battle. The
army of Kordofan, deprived of its leader, turned and took to
flight; they were pursued by the Turkish cavalry, and many of them
killed on this route. Amongst the dead on the field of battle three
women were even found, who had taken an active part in the fight
for their freedom. On the second day after this battle, the
Defturdar entered Lobeid with his victorious army. The town was
plundered, and nearly wholly sacked; the Defturdar found
immeasurable treasure in this place, which this avaricious tyrant
immediately appropriated to himself. The country surrendered
without further resistance, excepting the mountain of “Dyre,”
situated at twenty hours’ march from Lobeid, which has retained its
freedom to the present day. The Turkish army suffered deprivations
of all kinds;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> the
greater part fell victims to the climate, and but few survived who
could withstand its pernicious influence, and thus escaped with
their lives.</p>

<p>Kordofan, excepting the free Nuba, is now divided into five
districts; a Casheff, or captain, presiding over each; a colonel,
resident in Lobeid, is governor of the province, and no pen can
describe to what oppression the country is now subjected; all signs
of wealth have entirely disappeared, and it is, as it were, drained
by the Turks, who will not suffer any private person to attain the
slightest degree of opulence. Many of the natives, tired of this
oppression, have emigrated with all their possessions, and sought
refuge either in Darfour, or in Takeli; and even as lately as the
year 1838 the inhabitants of six villages have left the country.
Nothing is now discernible but poverty and misery; inhabitants of
even moderate means are not to be met with, if we, perhaps, except
some few Djelabi.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The various tribes inhabiting the country at present are the
following: Hadejat, el Giomme, Bederie, Shiswaba, el Etoman,
Ogendiab, Birget, Dombab, Almakaita, Elberiab, Hassenie, Hawara,
Felata, Denagle or Dongolavi, Darhammer, Abusanun, Darhami, Serauy,
Freseh, Basaue, el Maramera, Volet el Angon, Czahalin, Kubbabeesh
(Sheikh Salé), Benecira, Hababin (Sheikh Abdel Mahmud),
Elhauwasma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> (Sheikh
Moosa), el Messerie (Sheikh Labaied), Koncieri or Darfurer, Pergu,
and Nas-Gioffon;<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> but these people may be arranged collectively
under three heads, namely: the Negroes; the Bakkari and Arabs or
free people; and the Dongolavi. All these various tribes differ in
their manners and customs, if not totally, at least to a certain
extent, and speak thirteen dialects and languages among them.</p>

<p>The total population of Kordofan may be computed at 400,000
souls, excluding the nomadic Bakkari. The Defturdar did all in his
power to degrade this country, and his name is, even at the present
day, a word of terror to the natives. Terribly, indeed, the tyrant
abused his authority in this unhappy country; no pen can describe
the cruelties which he perpetrated in the province. Human nature
revolts at hearing the inventions of this ruffian, practised upon
his unfortunate victims for the mere gratification of his passion
of cruelty. I should not have believed every rumour, or have
regarded the accounts I heard of the atrocities of this man, for
the most part, in the light of fiction, if I had not received
corroborating evidence in all the districts of Kordofan, Sennaar
and Egypt, through which I travelled; tales the more worthy of
credit, inasmuch as many persons are yet living who were not
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> eye-witnesses of
all these deeds of horror, but even themselves sufferers by his
cruelty.</p>

<p>I may, perhaps, be permitted to illustrate a few traits in the
character of this ruthless tyrant by narrating some of his feats;
it will then become evident, that this flourishing country could
but sink in a very short time, as the natural consequence of his
oppressive tyranny; and that a considerable period must elapse
before it will be able to recover itself but slightly.</p>

<p>A soldier who had stolen a sheep from a peasant was caught in
the very act. He not only refused to return the stolen goods, but
even maltreated the peasant. Confiding in the equity of his cause,
the latter thought he should more probably have justice done him by
the governor than by any one else, and entered a complaint against
the soldier. The Defturdar listened very patiently to the story;
but, when the peasant had finished, the tyrant accosted him in an
angry voice, with the words: “And with these trifles you trouble
me?” Then turning to his attendants he ordered the peasant to be
brought before the kadi; they understood immediately that he meant
by the kadi, a cannon, carried the poor wretch immediately off, and
bound him to the mouth of a gun which was instantly fired.</p>

<p>His very servants, consisting not only of slaves, but of free
Arabs and Turks, although they might be regarded as his
executioners, stood in great awe of him, for he punished the
slightest offence of which they might be guilty with every
imaginable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> species of
cruelty. Thus it happened that one of these servants was tempted to
dip his finger into a dish to taste it. The Defturdar,
unfortunately, observed the act. He demanded of the unhappy man, in
an ironical tone, whether the dish were sweet or sour? The servant
was naturally mute with fear. The Defturdar now ordered him to be
nailed by the tongue to the door and his face to be smeared with
honey, in order, as he expressed himself, to stimulate his
gustatory faculties. In this position the unfortunate man had to
pass two full hours. It took a long time before he recovered, and a
variety of remedies were required to heal his tongue.</p>

<p>A seyss or groom, whose office is, according to custom in Egypt,
to run before the rider, was incapable of keeping up with the
Defturdar from absolute fatigue, in a long and quick trot. The
tyrant struck him with his whip to quicken his pace. The
unfortunate man, who was, however, quite exhausted, as may be
supposed, did not become more active after this remedy had been
applied. For this crime the unnatural barbarian had his feet bound
to the tail of a horse, and ordered the animal to be driven through
the streets of Lobeid by two other seyss. The unhappy groom would,
no doubt, have met with his death in this manner, were not the
streets paved merely with fine sand; thus he received many wounds,
but none which proved mortal. The horse, unaccustomed to such
usage, turned suddenly round, and struck at the unfortunate seyss,
who, in desperation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
seized the animal with all his remaining strength by the head; and
to save himself bit into its upper lip. No attention was at first
paid to this slight wound, but in a short time the head of the
horse began to swell, and it eventually died. The seyss who was
covered with wounds, however, survived the torture.</p>

<p>A man gave his neighbour, in a quarrel, a box on the ears; the
latter brought a complaint against him before the Defturdar. “With
which hand didst thou strike thy neighbour?” asked the tyrant.
“With the right,” answered the peasant. “Well,” replied the
Defturdar, “that thou mayst not forget it, I shall have the flesh
removed from the palm of that hand.” This order was immediately
executed. “Now return to thy work,” said the Defturdar to the
sufferer, who, writhing with pain, replied: “In this state I cannot
work.”—“What!” exclaimed the tyrant in a rage; “thou darest to
contradict me! cut his tongue out, it is rather too long!” and this
operation was also immediately performed, without consideration of
the tortures to which he had been previously subjected.</p>

<p>The Defturdar one day observed, that some one had taken a pinch
of snuff out of his box during his absence; his suspicion lighted
upon his valet; he, therefore, on a subsequent occasion, confined a
fly in his box and leaving it in his divan went into another room,
and ordered his servant to fetch something from the chamber in
which he had put down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the box. The servant fell into the snare, was really tempted to
take a pinch, and the fly escaped without being observed. In a
short time the Defturdar returned to the room, found that the fly
had escaped from its confinement, and immediately asked the servant
“Who had opened the box?”—“I, sir,” he confidently replied; “I took
a pinch.” This liberty he paid with his life: the ruffian had him
flogged to death.</p>

<p>A negro bought milk of a women for five paras,<a id=
"FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
drank it, but forgot the payment; the woman complained to the
Defturdar, who happened to be in the neighbourhood. “Well,” said
he, “I will immediately investigate the affair,” and ordered the
offending negro to be instantly brought before him. When he
appeared, he asked him, if he had bought milk of that woman and not
paid for it? The negro in fear denied it. The barbarian immediately
ordered the abdomen of the negro to be cut open, to see whether his
stomach contained the milk. It was, indeed, found; whereupon he
quietly said to the woman: “Thou art right, take these five paras,
and now go thy ways.”</p>

<p>In his garden the Defturdar had a den, in which he kept a lion;
the animal became gradually so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_22">[22]</span> tame that he ran about at liberty in the
grounds, and followed his master like a dog. Of this tame lion the
tyrant made use to frighten the people who came before him, a
species of wanton sport in which he took the greatest pleasure. If
it so happened that no stranger came to visit him during the hour
in which he engaged himself in his garden, he ordered his
attendants to bring any person they might meet on the high roads to
him. The invitation was sufficient in itself to frighten any one to
death; but when an unfortunate man in the greatest trepidation
entered the garden, and in absolute fear of his life creeping along
the earth, approached the Defturdar, he set the lion at him, and
the poor fellow, of course, fell senseless to the ground at the
sight of the wild beast. This was now his greatest delight; for,
although the animal did no harm, it was sufficient to frighten the
most courageous man to be brought in close contact with a rampant
lion.</p>

<p>Before this animal was quite domesticated, and whilst it was yet
kept in confinement, one of the gardener’s assistants was guilty of
some error, of which the superintendant complained to the
Defturdar. In no case dilatory in passing judgment, he ordered the
accused, without going into details, or listening even to the full
explanation of the case, to be cast into the lion’s den. This order
was immediately complied with; the beast, however, treated the poor
condemned wretch like a second Daniel; it not only did him no harm,
but, to the astonishment<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_23">[23]</span> of all beholders, licked his hands. The
gardener’s assistant was not the animal’s attendant, but had
occasionally thrown some of his bread into the den in passing. The
noble animal had not forgotten this kindness, and spared his
benefactor’s life. The Defturdar, on hearing this, was by no means
pleased; but bloodthirsty as ever, and without feeling the
slightest appreciation for this act of generosity, ordered the lion
to be kept fasting during the whole of the day, and the delinquent
to remain in confinement, thinking in the anger of ungratified
rage, to force the beast to become the executioner of its
benefactor. But even hunger could not overcome the magnanimity of
the royal animal, and the poor gardener remained the whole day
unhurt in the den with the lion.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the evening he was
liberated, but the unfortunate man did not long escape the
vengeance of the tyrant, who, meeting him one day in the garden,
where he had brushed up a heap of leaves, accosted him with, “Dog,
thou art so bad that a lion will not eat thee, but now thou hast
made thine own grave.” Hereupon he commanded him to carry the dry
leaves to an oven, and then to creep in himself. When this order
was executed the tyrant had the leaves lighted, and the poor wretch
expired under the most horrid tortures.</p>

<p>A Fellah (peasant) owed the government forty<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> maamle,<a id=
"FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the
sheikh of his village had his last ox seized, the fellah declaring
himself incapable of paying. The beast was slaughtered and divided
into forty parts: the butcher received the head and skin for his
trouble, and the remaining forty parts were sold at one maamle
each, to the inhabitants of the village promiscuously. The meat, as
may be supposed, was quickly sold at this low price. The poor
peasant now appeared with a complaint before the Defturdar,
assuring him that the ox was worth more than forty maamle. The
Defturdar proceeded with all speed to the village, to investigate
the matter on the spot. Having convinced himself of the truth, he
ordered the sheikh, the butcher, and all those persons who had
bought a portion of the confiscated ox, to be called together, and
reproached the sheikh, in presence of all for his unlawful conduct.
The butcher now received the order to slaughter the sheikh and to
divide his body into forty parts. Every former purchaser was
obliged to buy a part at a price of one maamle, and to carry the
flesh home with him. The money was handed over to the Fellah as an
indemnification for the ox which had been taken from him.</p>

<p>At the feast of the Baëram<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> all the servants
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> seyss, eighteen
in number, went before the Defturdar to offer their congratulations
according to custom, and begged at the same time for a pair of new
shoes. “You shall have them,” said he. He now had the farrier
called, and commanded him to make eighteen pairs of horse-shoes to
fit the feet of his servants; these were ready on the next day,
whereupon he ordered two shoes to be nailed to the soles of the
feet of each of the eighteen servants without mercy. Nine of them
died in a short time of mortification; he then had the survivers
unshod, and consigned them to the care of a medical man.</p>

<p>But, enough of the atrocities perpetrated by this tiger in human
shape, cruelties which are neither to be justified nor excused.
Volumes might be filled with instances of tyranny of which this
barbarian was guilty in the conquered country of Kordofan, in
Sennaar, and Egypt. No single day passed without its tribute to his
blood-thirsty cruelty. His power of invention of tortures for his
unfortunate victims was extraordinary, and he was always capable of
lighting upon some new mode of gratifying his revengeful
disposition. His name will remain unforgotten for ages in Kordofan,
Sennaar, and Egypt, and is yet an object of terror to all who hear
it. Mehemed Ali, wearied of the complaints which daily reached him
against this tyrant, at last had a bowl of poison presented to him.
I myself saw several of the victims of his cruelty who had been
fortunate enough to escape with their lives, but<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> wandered about the country as
cripples, begging their daily bread from their neighbours, deprived
of their noses, ears, or tongues, or with their eyes put out.</p>

<p>We may now easily imagine what fate befel this ill-starred
country, when it became subject to the Turks. In former days, the
inhabitants lived in freedom, without care, in the consciousness of
security of property, or at least of life; but, when the Turks
gained possession of this province, a total change took place; from
that moment, the right of property ceased to exist, and the
government considered all possessions as its own. Add to this the
inhuman conduct of the Defturdar, which brought the people to the
verge of despair; for the slightest suspicion that any one subject
had amassed a small fortune, either in goods, money, or cattle, was
sufficient to bring him, under some pretext, to death, in order to
be able to confiscate his property. The Defturdar was insatiable;
he robbed everything, if he only knew where to find it, and had
thus collected immeasurable wealth in a very short space of
time.</p>

<p>The government is, indeed, at present, rather more lenient, and
its officers have received a check in their arbitrary abuse of
power; but the distance from the seat of government is too great to
render the superior authorities cognizant of all abuses, too many
of which, unfortunately, yet afflict this doomed province.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span><a id=
"c03"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="med">GOVERNMENT.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> form of government of Kordofan
resembles that of other countries under Egyptian sway, that is to
say, it is despotic; but the inhabitants of this province are
subjected to particularly severe oppression, being situate, as we
have above observed, at so great a distance from the seat of
government, that it indeed almost amounts to an impossibility to
proffer a complaint to the first authorities.</p>

<p>The people feel themselves, therefore, extremely miserable, the
more so since, under the dominion of Sennaar and Darfour, neither
property nor life were endangered, as they are at present. The
difference may be deduced from the fact, that, in former times,
nearly all the women wore ornaments of gold, a metal which is now
rarely, or never seen in the province.</p>

<p>Under the government of Darfour, there were no taxes, no duties,
trade was free, and everywhere reigned opulence. Now the reverse is
observed. Duties and imposts of every description
oppress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> the people,
and have reduced them to abject poverty. The old proverb, “Where a
Turk sets his foot no grass will grow,” is, in this province,
adequately exemplified. The originator of all this misery was,
undoubtedly, the Defturdar, the conqueror of this country. With the
conquest, government was out of the question, for every one was
subjected to arbitrary and tyrannical treatment. Mehemed Ali,
indeed, recalled the Defturdar, but the people experienced, on the
whole, no material relief by this measure, for the subsequent
governors were by no means idle in scraping treasure together, and
gradually exhausted all the sap from this already impoverished
country. The province is now governed by the Bey, (colonel,) of the
first regiment of the line, quartered at Lobeid, to whom the
Casheffs, (chief magistrates of the five districts, and generally
captains in the same regiment,) are subordinate. The Bey is again
responsible to the Pasha (general) of Khartoom, who is, at the same
time, governor of the whole Belled Soodan.<a id=
"FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The Bey, or governor, is the superior authority in all civil and
military affairs; his decision is peremptory; but, in matters of
importance, orders must be received from Khartoom. In judicial
cases, the kadi passes judgment, and the governor sees it executed;
this, however, is generally a mere<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_29">[29]</span> blind, to keep up the appearance of a just
administration of the law to the people, for every judgment is
perfectly arbitrary.</p>

<p>The revenue consists of the ordinary taxes, and in the levy of
custom duties, but these are never exacted in proper proportion, or
after a fixed scale; for when a contribution is ordered to be
levied from Cairo, the country is generally forced to contribute
double the amount,—a very natural consequence, when we consider
that all the government situations are held by officers, who
purchase their commissions from the governor. It is, of course, an
understood thing, that one functionary endeavours to outbid the
other, in which practice he is encouraged by the knowledge, that he
will in time be able to make good his outlay. They certainly cannot
reckon on enjoying their privileges for any length of time; for if
a person present himself, and pay a few purses of money more, the
colonel is not long in finding a cause for turning one of his
former employes out of office, and conferring the vacant situation
on the new candidate. Every officer, therefore, endeavours to
extort as much as he possibly can by oppression, in the shortest
possible time, in order to reimburse himself for his expenditure,
and to gain something by his bargain. Each casheff, or captain of a
district, is provided with a few subordinate officers, who are
distributed in the distant localities. These subalterns, and the
Sheikhs el Belled, or village magistrates, must
occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> make
presents to the casheffs. The sheikhs are by no means thoughtless
of themselves; and lastly, the copts, who perform the duties of
secretaries, all and every one prey upon the small gains of the
poor inhabitants, so that we may easily conceive what the
unfortunate people have to suffer. Mehemed Ali, acquainted with the
arbitrary proceedings of the governors, and subordinate
functionaries, notwithstanding the great distance from the scene of
their rapacity, has done everything in his power to put a limit to
these impositions. Thus, in the years 1838 and 1839, a greater part
of the <em>employés</em> were summoned before a commission of
enquiry, and sent into different provinces,—in short, everything
was done to bring about a just administration, but all in vain.
With the best intentions, the Viceroy was incapable of curing the
cancer which preyed upon the bowels of the land; and although,
indeed, much of the property, which had been unjustly scraped
together,—or we should rather say, the plunder of the government
functionaries,—was confiscated; the Viceroy was, in the end, the
gainer, not the people. To the latter, nothing is returned; and
this restitution, indeed, would be no easy undertaking, inasmuch as
the individual sufferers could not be readily found, and Mehemed
Ali, moreover, does not trouble himself in the slightest about the
matter. It is true that the country swarms with spies, who observe
every action of the government officers with great accuracy, and
make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> their reports in
a higher quarter; but the state, in these cases, confiscates the
plunder, as I have before mentioned, and the poor people receive no
indemnification. The interests of the separate functionaries are,
moreover, too closely united for the one to place any impediment in
the way of the other. The judges are bribed, and a mere deposition,
or loss of office, generally terminates the affair. When the
detected fraud is, however, too flagitious, the criminated officer
is immediately sent into a distant province, and then prosecuted,
in order that he may have no opportunity of coming to an
understanding with his judges, or accusers. In this case he is
certainly lost; but the state confiscates the proceeds of his
rapacity, and his successor plunders and extorts again, as much as
he possibly can, as long as he can manage to keep his actions
secret.</p>

<p>An additional, and chief grievance, is the circumstance of the
Viceroy being obliged to treat the governors with the utmost lenity
and forbearance; for he knows full well how dangerous it would be
to irritate them, and thus, perhaps, to goad them on to rebellion.
In one moment the whole Belled Soodan would be lost, and not so
easily regained. The troops of the garrison consist of native
negroes, who implicitly obey those who give them the most, or
merely make them the largest promises, and who more especially
treat them with kindness. The country in general detests the
Viceroy, believing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
him to be the cause of all the oppression under which it groans, as
it considers all the acts of injustice, under which it has to
suffer, to be perpetrated by his orders. In case of a governor,
therefore, rebelling against the government, the whole province
would instantly attach itself to his faction, if he merely released
them of a portion of their taxation. To re-conquer the country by
force of arms would be a more difficult matter than it was twenty
years ago; we know what resistance the negroes of Kordofan and
Sennaar offered the Turks, when armed with spears and swords only;
and at present, there are 15,000 muskets in the arsenal at
Khartoom, which would give the insurgents no small advantage.
Mehemed Ali knows all this very well, and acts very wisely in
conciliating the governors: the authority of the latter is,
therefore, virtually far greater than that of the Viceroy, and most
wofully do they use it to their advantage; for, with few
exceptions, they exert unlimited power, are masters over life and
death, as also over the property of the people. A code of laws has
certainly been instituted, but these are totally disregarded, and
in every case will is law. Judgment is sometimes even passed
according to the whim or fancy of the individual in the most
unjustifiable manner. During my residence in this country, I had
the opportunity of convincing myself of this fact.</p>

<p>A Turk, who travelled with a large quantity of goods, was
murdered in the desert of Bahiouda,<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_33">[33]</span> and robbed of his property. All
investigations and endeavours to detect the murderer proved
fruitless; thus much was, however, subsequently discovered, that
the goods had been sold at Darfour, and it was suspected that the
perpetrator of the crime was secreted in Kordofan. Several persons
were taken into custody, and examined, but in vain; the delinquent
could not be discovered. A prophetess, who, by casting a handful of
shells on the sand, pretended to be able to look into futurity, and
to explain the past, arrived, by means of her mystic art, at the
conclusion, that the son of the Sheikh of Haraza was the murderer.
The result of her sorcery was imparted to the governor, Mohammed
Bey, in conversation over a pipe of tobacco. The governor, a man of
weak mind, who placed more confidence in the idle talk of an old
woman, than in common sense, gave credence to this tale, and had
the man accused instantly arrested, and conducted by a party of
soldiers to Lobeid; he was then loaded with irons, and cast into
prison; whereupon the investigation immediately took place.
Although he asserted that he was at that time in quite a different
place, and was able to corroborate this statement by witnesses, the
testimony of a fortune-teller was regarded as better evidence, and
the unfortunate man was subjected to the most cruel tortures to
force a confession from him. He was bound, by order of the
governor, hand and foot, close to a large fire, whence a soldier
took a burning branch,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_34">[34]</span> and burnt his body; he received twenty
wounds, and not until he writhed like a worm with pain and anger
did the governor put a stop to the cruelty. The true criminal was
shortly after this discovered, and the son of the Sheikh, who had
been so frightfully tortured, was now proved to be innocent; but no
one could alleviate his sufferings, and any further compensation
was totally out of the question.</p>

<p>When an individual is guilty of any offence, the examination
generally takes place as soon as he is arrested, judgment is
quickly passed, and instantly executed. Two circumstances are,
however, necessary for the conviction of the party accused,—namely,
detection in the act, or confession. If he plead not guilty, and
deny the charge, he is submitted to torture, and thus it frequently
happens that the innocent suffer for the guilty.</p>

<p>Stealing a slave, an ox, a camel, an ass, &amp;c., is punished
by the loss of a hand. The judgment is executed by the first
butcher casually met with in the streets. The delinquent is ordered
to lay his hand upon a block, in which situation it is held down by
two men: the butcher then chops it off. The stump is immediately
thrust into a vessel containing butter, heated nearly to the
boiling point, which stands in readiness, for the purpose of
stopping hæmorrhage, and preventing mortification, and the limb is
then enveloped in a rag. In the course of ten minutes all is over,
and the sufferer returns home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Murder, with the
exception of negroes, is of very rare occurrence. One single
instance of this crime occurred in the year 1838; the murderer was
detected, and, after a short examination, hung on a gibbet erected
in front of the house of the governor. In praise of Mehemed Ali, it
must be stated that there is not at present that danger for an
European travelling through the country as was the case during the
time it was under the government of Darfour, when no Djelabi could
venture to undertake a journey into this province, excepting under
the protection of a considerable escort. At present, any person may
traverse the country from one end to the other without fear. I
myself, on nearly all occasions, travelled alone, or merely
accompanied by my servant, and never met with the slightest delay
from robberies, or other hinderances; on the contrary, I was
everywhere received with the utmost hospitality and courtesy,—the
more so when it became gradually known that I was no Turk, although
of white colour, but a Frank.</p>

<p>Cases of petty larceny are of frequent occurrence; for thieving
is almost a congenital vice with many of the negroes. What they see
they wish to possess, and if it be not given to them freely, they
will watch their opportunity of appropriating it to themselves; but
we never find several persons conspiring together to commit a
robbery.</p>

<p>A single mountain,—“Mount Dyre,” inhabited by negroes, who have
not yet been brought to submission,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_36">[36]</span> is to be dreaded; for these people live
solely by plunder and robbery. They make incursions into the
neighbouring country in large bodies, even to Milbes, situate at
three hours’ march from Lobeid, and steal and rob everything that
comes in their way, both men and cattle, which they either use for
their own purposes, or sell to others, The Djelabi, and other
travellers, avoid this hill, by making a great circuit, in order to
escape the negroes of “Dyre.”</p>

<p>The jurisdiction over the offences and crimes of slaves, is an
affair <i>sui generis</i>. This class of beings is not looked upon,
or treated as men, but as cattle. The master of a slave acts as
judge in cases of offences, which the one or the other may commit
in his house. If one slave murder or stab the other, the proprietor
must bear the loss, if both the slaves be his property; and he can
merely punish the criminal, or sell him, if he please. In this
case, the affair is regarded in the same light as when, in Europe,
one horse kills the other, both belonging to the same owner. If, on
the other hand, the murdered slave be the property of another, the
proprietor of the murderer must make the loss good; and only if he
refuse, or offer too little, proceedings at law are entered
upon,—not a criminal process for murder, but a suit for damages.
Only in case a slave murder a free man, is he ever brought to
trial, and executed according to sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>The revenue is
collected partly in money, partly in kind, <i>i. e.</i>, in
products, or slaves; there is no systematic arrangement in the mode
in which the contribution is levied; the governor fixes the rate,
and it is the duty of the casheffs, and Sheikhs-el Belled, to
collect it. Whosoever is suspected of possessing any treasure is
forced to give it up, or his cattle, or other property, is taken
away from him by force. In the year 1838, the country was obliged
to contribute, in addition to the imposts in money, beside cattle,
butter, and slaves, 4,000 ardeb<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> (about 118,000 sacks) of
doura,<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a> or millet; and the Bakkara nomadic tribes,
12,000 oxen, and kine. Cattle is only received from the villagers
when they cannot produce cash; a large ox is then taken by the
government to the value of 35 piaster, (3 fl., 30 kr., C.M.; about
9 shillings sterling). During several years, 8,000 heads of horned
cattle were annually sent to Cairo, the greater part of which
perished on the road. The government have now had their eyes opened
to the absurdity of driving beasts so great a distance, and the
transport of cattle to Cairo has consequently ceased; they are now
only driven to Khartoom. The cash received as revenue proceeds from
taxes, duties, the sale of slaves, and other produce of the
country. It is impossible to describe<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_38">[38]</span> the cruelty with which the taxes and
contributions are collected; and it is really wonderful that it
should be yet possible to drain a country, where so little trade is
carried on, of such large sums annually. But this state of things
cannot last long; for the ready money decreases with every year,
and the trade of the country is scarcely worthy of consideration.
The people will, in fact, eventually be obliged to emigrate, as
they have already from several parts, or a general insurrection
will be the result; this revolution would, indeed, have taken place
in 1838, if a leader had been forthcoming. Droughts, or excess of
rains, may cause the harvest, in many districts, to fail, or the
locusts may totally devour it; the cattle, moreover, may fall a
prey to epidemic diseases; but none of these circumstances are ever
taken into consideration, and the contributions are levied without
mercy or compassion. In the year 1838, the inhabitants of several
villages, were forced, in consequence of an unsuccessful harvest,
to take refuge in a forest, and to live upon the fruit of a tree,
called Egelit, and on milk; but the government knew very well where
to find them, and took away all their cattle. When a village has
nothing left wherewith to pay its taxes, it is obliged to find a
certain number of slaves, who are drafted as recruits into the
various regiments, or publicly sold; in the former case, the
government receives these slaves at a value of 150 to 300 piasters,
(15 to 30 fl., C.M.; from 30 shillings to £3 10s.) a-head; children
at 30 piasters, or more;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_39">[39]</span> but always below the market price, in order
that Mehemed Ali, the great slave-merchant, may gain something by
the bargain, at the expense of his oppressed subjects. A great
portion of the imposts is even now paid in slaves; and on these
occasions truly revolting scenes frequently take place. Should it
ever happen that Mehemed Ali puts an end to slave-hunting, as he
has confidently promised, he would yet remain the most extensive
slave-merchant, because he endeavours to cover his revenues by
slaves, and receives them in lieu of money. It is, indeed, much
easier in this country to find a slave than a dollar of ready
money; and this state of things is rather on the increase than on
the decrease. With what right, may I ask, is Mehemed Ali called, by
many Europeans, the civilizer of his country, when we have ample
proof of his forcing his people to steal slaves, in order to be
able to satisfy his claims as regent! Many of these subjects meet
with an untimely end in these expeditions; for the negroes defend
their freedom most stubbornly. If a native of Kordofan lose his
father, his brother, or his friend, in one of these private
depredatory excursions, he lays the blame on the free negroes, and
endeavours to revenge the death of his relative; he becomes cruel,
and, lastly, stains himself with the crime of murder, whilst the
blame is due to no one but Mehemed Ali, the great slave-trader.
Even if it were really ever to happen, that the transport of slaves
to Cairo should cease, I have a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_40">[40]</span> strong suspicion that those slaves which
Mehemed Ali receives in Kordofan, and elsewhere, in payment of
imposts, would be sold to the Djelabi, to be transported into
Arabia, to which country thousands are being daily sent.</p>

<p>As far as my observations went during my sojourn in this
country, and it is an opinion of the correctness of which I had the
opportunity of convincing myself in a great measure, there are many
sources in the state to cover its revenue, without proceeding to
such extreme and inhuman measures as slave-hunting or
slave-trading. The sugar-cane grows here without cultivation and
thrives exceedingly. The soil is, in many situations, well adapted
to the growth of indigo, and the country would yield many other
products, if the experiment were made, and water were not so scarce
as it is in many situations. Although the White Nile flows close to
the confines of the province, yet the water of this river could not
be rendered serviceable for the irrigation of Kordofan by means of
a canal, for the excavation of the bed would cost millions of
money, and the country is so elevated that a simple canal would not
answer the purpose. No less than twenty thousand heads of horned
cattle might, with ease, be annually sent to Egypt, for there is no
lack of pasturage; but the transport of cattle should be intrusted
to the care of more sensible people than it has been hitherto, who
have acted entirely on their<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_41">[41]</span> own discretion. Mehemed Ali has, further, not
yet made an attempt to derive any benefit from the large forests of
gum trees in Nubia. They might be a source of great profit to the
state, and would prove far more productive than those contemptible
and atrocious slave-hunts. He need only employ the tenth part of
those troops whose services are required in these abominable
excursions as inspectors in collecting the gum, and allow the
negroes of Nubia small wages, as is done in Kordofan; both the
state and the people would in this way gain, and the negroes would
enjoy their liberty; their confidence in the government would be
augmented, when they came to understand that they were treated as a
free people and not as slaves; trade, commerce, and agriculture
would, by this measure, receive a stimulus and improve; and every
man would with pleasure engage in an undertaking whence a small
profit might be expected, because he would not have to tremble for
his freedom and his life. The mountains of Nubia might yield from
ten to twenty thousand cantari<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of gum of the best quality
annually; and Mehemed Ali would soon find out, that he could with
as much ease obtain two cantari of gum as one slave, and that the
acquisition would be attended with less expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>The governors and
government functionaries look upon Kordofan as their private
property, and, regarding the inhabitants as slaves, treat them as
such, in every sense of the word; thus the country is subjected to
every possible species of extortion. In the year 1838, Mehemed Ali
determined to undertake a journey to Sennaar. Many cases of
oppression had probably reached his ears which were likely to lead
to proceedings, and might prove productive of considerable sums. On
his arrival at Khartoom, he summoned the chief sheikhs of Kordofan
into his presence, and listened to the complaints of his subjects.
On accurate investigation, and where he was convinced of unlawful
actions he had the guilty party immediately prosecuted. Thus the
governor of Kordofan was deposed, and all the staff-officers, with
nine other officers and copts, were brought to trial. Much property
which had been illegally acquired was certainly confiscated; but,
as I have before observed, Mehemed Ali was, in the end, the sole
gainer by this measure, and not the people. On his departure, the
former arbitrary system prevailed; he left, indeed, strict orders
with the governor and other government officers, rigorously
prohibiting them from indulging in cruelties, but these measures
were insufficient to mitigate the evil. Mehemed Ali was, on this
occasion, cunning enough, in travelling to Fazoglo, to liberate a
convoy of slaves he casually met on the road, who<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> had but a few days before left
their native hills;—but why? Because several Europeans were in his
suite. No such orders were left in Kordofan; the stipulated number
of five thousand slaves were delivered to a man. I was the only
European at that time in Kordofan, and the governor condescended to
request that I would not mention this circumstance in Europe. The
country, in fine, could only be relieved and gradually raised from
its present degraded state, by sending a governor to Kordofan who
would act, not upon private interest, but on the interests of the
state and people: in fact, as a man, as well as a diplomatist.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span><a id=
"c04"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="med">HABITS AND CUSTOMS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> dwelling-places, in Kordofan, are
called “tukkoli,” and are of extremely simple construction. The
house is generally ten to twelve feet in diameter, and of a
circular form; it has but one single entrance, which answers the
purpose of door, window, and chimney, and is just large enough for
a man to creep in whilst stooping. One house is as like the other
as one egg is like its fellow, for there is no scope for
architectural display; as the residences of the negroes are built
on the same plan at the present day, and formed of the same
materials they were centuries ago. A certain number of wooden poles
are stuck into the ground, in a circular form, according to the
dimensions required, and, being bent inwards, form a fork above. A
second series, exactly similar to the first, is added, and the ends
are bound together in a point, so that the second layer has the
shape of a sugar loaf, and constitutes the roof. The whole fabric
is then combined with a kind of basket-work<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_45">[45]</span> and covered with dokn<a id=
"FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
straw. The apex of the roof forms a basket, which serves as a nest
for the black stork, which generally returns in the months of May
and July from its migrations, and hatches its young in the nests it
finds ready formed. If no stork happen to build on one or the other
of these “tukkoli,” three or four ostrich’s eggs are placed, by way
of ornament, on a pole erected perpendicularly on the top of the
roof.</p>

<p>Simple as is the construction of these houses, they may be said,
on an average, to be very firmly built, so that a drop of water
seldom penetrates during the heaviest shower in the rainy season,
and they afford, at least, a dry place of shelter. From two to five
of these tukkoli are generally built for one family, and the whole
homestead is then hedged in with a fence of thorn; an opening is
left in this hedge for the gate, represented by a bush of thorn,
which is taken away and replaced after entrance or egress from the
enclosure. This is not done from any apprehension of thieves or of
any other intrusion, but to keep the hungry camels, who would
devour the house, in a short time, down to the very framework, at a
respectful distance. These thorn fences are a great inconvenience,
and even dangerous to strangers, for, if they do not exactly shed
blood, they will seldom enter them or quit them without leaving a
portion of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
dress thereunto attached. The expense of building a house of this
description is very trifling; the poorest people, therefore, are
able to erect their own tukkoli. Wood may be cut in the forests
without any charge being made for it; certainly those who do not
happen to grow corn, and consequently have no straw, are obliged to
buy this material. The expense, however, rarely exceeds from five
to ten piasters, (less than three shillings;) for which sum, a
sufficient quantity may be bought to keep out every drop of water
during the severest shower. Labourers are not paid, for each man
assists his neighbour gratuitously. These houses present another
and very desirable advantage, putting aside the consideration that
the material costs a mere trifle and the building but little
trouble; for every man can have his house carried away, by ten or
twelve men, in two divisions, and quickly again erected in a
different place, if the site did not please him, or a disagreeable
neighbour rendered his prior residence unpleasant to him. If fire
break out in a village, no attempt is made to extinguish it, as it
would be labour in vain, but the houses nearest to the seat of
conflagration are conveyed out of the reach of danger, and a limit
is thus put to the raging element. Whole villages are sometimes
carried away, when an insect happens to infest the neighbourhood,
and renders residence in a certain district insupportable. The
animal is the ricinus,<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> called<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> there “kurat;” it harbours in
the sand, whence it issues, in astonishing numbers, to attack those
who may happen to sit down on the sand naked, as the negroes do.
This little animal then immediately approaches and bites most
severely. The camels stand in great awe of it, immediately take
flight, and cannot be made to stop in a place where it is to be met
with. The sting of this insect is only to be avoided by sitting on
straw mats, for they seldom creep upon these.</p>

<p>Every family possesses an additional hut, (called “moraka,”) in
which the flour necessary for the consumption of the house is
ground. This operation is performed in a hollow stone, a species of
rude mortar, which is fixed into the ground, whilst a girl,
generally a slave, reduces the grain (dokn) with another
cylindrical stone to a powder. In a family consisting of eight
persons, one girl would be occupied throughout the whole year in
grinding the necessary quantity of corn. This simple labour
requires great exertion, and is only to be performed by girls who
have attained their fourteenth year, younger children being unequal
to the task. Even grown persons suffer considerably in this
occupation, for it requires no slight exertion to roll a heavy
stone all day long backwards and forwards<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_48">[48]</span> in the heat of these huts; the poor creatures
thus employed are generally bathed in perspiration, and yet they
may be heard singing all day long. Their songs are certainly merely
expressive of their desire to escape, or of longing after their
homes. The chaunts are very peculiar, and, with few exceptions, the
impromptu pouring-forth of the feelings of the singer, according to
the custom prevalent over nearly the whole of the East.</p>

<p>Few songs are to be met with which the one learns of the other;
for each individual sings exactly what he thinks, without any
regard to metre or time. For their dances the natives have a few
peculiar melodies, which, however, are frequently altered by
variations of their own composition. The young female slaves are
heard to sing chiefly in a minor key, and their notes are scarcely
audible in the next hut: the song will frequently run in the
following strain: “The sun is concealing itself behind the hills,
come people to the joyous dance; the cows are milked, the work is
done, light the fire; my lover comes to fetch me home, &amp;c.” A
tear may be seen to flow from the eye of many a girl as she thinks
of her native hills, over these songs; time, however, is capable of
assuaging the grief of these poor creatures, and after the lapse of
two or three years but few of them devote a thought to their native
country. In Egypt I have often conversed with both male and female
slaves who scarcely remembered their fatherland, which they the
more easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> forget,
as they meet with treatment in captivity they could not have
experienced under the paternal roof; they subsequently adopt the
customs and habits of the people with whom they are forced to live,
and frequently laugh at the simple customs of their own
country.</p>

<p>In the houses of the married there is a small elevation, of
about one foot and a half in height, in which an earthern pot is
immured up to its <i>embouchure</i>: this is called “tirankul,” and
is for the purpose of fumigating the person. Wood cut into thin
shavings, named “klet” and “telch,” is placed in the pot, and
ignited, whereupon the person performs the fumigation. This smoke
is very tonic in its operation, and so astringent that it
corrugates the skin. The shirts are also fumigated with sandal-wood
over this pot.</p>

<p>The influential and more opulent inhabitants of the village,
<i>e. g.</i> the sheikhs or the djelabis, possess, in addition to
the houses we have already described, a hut built in a quadrangular
form and called “rakuba:” they are more spacious than the common
dwellings, and are furnished with two entrances to admit of a freer
circulation of air, but are not tenantable during the rainy season
on account of the extreme lightness with which they are
constructed. This description of public building serves the purpose
of a place of abode for travellers, and is certainly preferable to
the dark and hot tukkoli, which are built rather for the rainy
season than for the dry and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_50">[50]</span> hot weather, during which period the people
live more in the open air. In Bari and Lobeid, where many Turks and
Dongolavi reside who look more to comfort, several spacious
residences are to be met with, constructed on the principle of
those observed in all Egyptian towns. The houses at Bari are more
substantially built than those at Lobeid, which are, literally
speaking, made of sand. An European architect would be much puzzled
to erect a house of this description, if he were shown the material
only. It consists of wood and sand; but as the swallows build their
nests with very slight material, which, however, in time becomes as
firm as stone, in like manner houses are constructed at Lobeid
which, although they will not last for ever, resist the
inclemencies of the weather for a great length of time, and afford
the occupant a secure place of shelter.</p>

<p>In several parts of the East I have had frequent opportunities
of observing that they build very neat dwellings as it were of
nothing. Houses, two stories in height, are frequently erected from
the ground in five or six weeks. The walls are represented by a
thick framework of wood, lined with a few bricks. A coating of
mortar covers the whole, and thus a house bears all the appearance
of being built of stone, and does not easily fall, especially where
they are not detached, but form streets, and the one, therefore,
supports the other. In Kordofan, on the other hand, each man builds
an isolated hut, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
every species of building material, excepting wood, is wanting; the
construction, therefore, is completely that of a swallow’s nest.
When a man has fixed upon the plot of ground on which he intends to
construct his house, the earth is excavated to the depth of half a
foot; and as much of the sand dug out as is necessary for the
building, is mixed with water in a well, at two or three paces
distant from the site of the building. The foundation is now
erected to a height of about two feet, and the labour is remitted
for two or three days, to allow the wall of sand to acquire the
proper firmness. This latter proceeding is the more essential as
the whole fabric would tumble to pieces before it had attained its
necessary height, unless this precaution were adopted. When the
destined elevation is completed, and the wall is thoroughly dry,
thin rafters are laid horizontally across it to form the skeleton
of the roof. Mats of straw are now placed upon the rafters, and
covered with a thin layer of sand, which is then wetted; small
pebbles of quartz are now strewn over this bed, and the whole mass
is firmly beaten together. A fabric of this nature is not unlike
<i>papier maché</i>, and, like the latter, would become perfectly
saturated with the first rain, and fall to pieces, if they did not
take the precaution of covering the whole with a coating of
cow-dung, which effectually keeps out water, and thus prevents the
occurrence of such a calamity. It will be easily conceived that a
house of this kind diffuses no very agreeable odour during
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> first few days
after erection, and that its colour is by no means the most
pleasing. In the rainy season this plastering has to be repeated
several times, and yet the rain frequently penetrates. I have lived
in one of these houses, and derived the greatest benefit from my
umbrella both by day and by night.</p>

<p>Most places are provided with draw-wells, but the water is on
the average very bad. The wells are situated at a short distance
from some of their places of residence, and the tributary springs
frequently dry up, as was the case in the year 1839, when many
villages suffered from want of water. In several localities, where
this element was formerly found at a depth of ten feet, it is now
necessary to dig to a depth of twenty feet before it can be
reached. About fifteen years ago water was found at twenty feet
below the level of the ground at Lobeid; at present fifty feet must
be penetrated before arriving at it. During the rainy season water
is, indeed, never wanting; but the rains do not last long, and that
which remains in the ponds either quickly evaporates, or becomes in
a short time so deteriorated that it could not be drank without
producing fatal consequences.</p>

<p>The arrangements in the interior of the tukkoli are as simple as
the huts themselves. In addition to an “angareb” (a bedstead or
frame, with straps fastened across it), a leathern shield, and a
few spears, the furniture consists of the following objects:—a pot,
called “burma,” for water; a second for boiling,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> and a third for “merissa” (a
species of beer); further a flat earthern dish “doka” for baking
bread; some few gourds for drinking; a wooden platter named “gedda”
for the boiled food; and a dish of straw plaited from the leaves of
the Doum palm, called “tabake.” Milk is kept in a basket formed of
rushes so densely interlaced that no fluid can percolate: to render
them thus impermeable they are steeped in boiling water immediately
after they are plaited. Provisions and other articles of domestic
economy are hung against the walls, to keep them from the mice and
white ants; these insects are a thorough plague in the country, and
nothing is safe from them; they will even gnaw and undermine the
wood-work of a house, and cause the whole fabric to fall to pieces.
Their habitation is the sand, especially where it is rather damp;
everything in fact that is placed on the ground is in danger of
being eaten up by them; chests and trunks should, therefore, be
placed upon stones, for they do not creep up these: the open air is
also fatal to the white ant. When they have gnawed anything to
pieces they leave a moisture mixed with sand, which becoming hard
forms an incrustation; and beneath this they carry on their work of
destruction. This covering is not intended to defend them from
other insects inimical to them, and likely to disturb them in their
work, but to guard themselves against the access of the air, which,
as I before mentioned, they cannot bear. I took all possible
pains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> to learn
something more of the habits of these animals, to find out where
they live and in what numbers they congregate. I have often dug to
a depth of one foot or two feet in the sand without meeting with
one single ant; and yet, if I placed a wooden chest on the ground,
where I had just been digging, I found in a short time the spot
covered with hundreds of these insects.</p>

<p>The interior of some of the tukkoli is decorated with beautiful
coloured straw mats; the angareb is also covered with variegated
matting, and serves, at the same time, as a couch. Two or three
ropes are drawn across the middle of the hut, to which ribbons, two
fingers in breadth, plaited of rushes, and spreading out
inferiorly, are attached; by these ligatures blue porcelain plates,
of English manufacture, are suspended, to contain food and preserve
it from the insects. A second cord is passed round the hut, to
which black glass bottles are hung, ornamented with gold paper;
part of these are empty, others again are filled with perfumery and
cosmetics belonging to the women, as grease, palm-oil, oil of
cloves, shebe,<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> telka,<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> etc. The walls are
decorated with a shield, a two-edged sword, and a few spears.
Before the tukkoli, a hollow cylinder made of cow-dung is
frequently met with, it is placed on stones, and is hermetically
closed with a lid. In this vessel the inhabitants keep their corn,
but a majority of them bury their stores under-ground. For this
purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> they dig a
pit, and line it internally with straw-matting; the corn is then
thrown in and covered with straw-mats; sand is now shot over the
whole, and the ground is levelled. Cabinets d’aisance are not known
to the natives; in these matters they imitate the cats. There are
no stalls or stables for the domestic animals; the cattle is penned
together in an enclosure of thorn, in the vicinity of the tukkoli.
The fence is exceedingly dense, intended to keep out the wild
beasts at night; and yet it frequently happens that a lion, or
hyæna, when urged by hunger, will effect an entry through the
thickest hedge, and carry away a sheep, a goat, or a calf.</p>

<p>The habits of the people are very simple, and their labour is
restricted to the most necessary employments. As soon as the day
begins to dawn old and young rise from their couches, and after
washing their faces, hands, and feet, in accordance with their
religion, proceed to work; the occupation of the majority, however,
consists in again retiring to the angareb. It is worthy of remark
that no one sleeps on the bare ground, and that the meanest slave
is provided with a mat to lie upon. In the houses of the more
respectable natives, one or two angarebs are always found on which
they sleep, while the lower orders are provided with straw-mats,
for no human being could endure lying on the mere ground for any
length of time; for the vermin harbouring in the sand would nearly
eat him up. The bed of a slave is certainly not of eiderdown, and
many Europeans, rising in the morning from a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_56">[56]</span> couch of this description, would consider
they had undergone a severe punishment; for these straw, or rather
cane-mats, are plaited from a species of reed, the stalks of which
are as thick as the little finger, and each particular reed is so
far apart in the texture, that their entire number may be counted
in the morning on the body of the slave. I have often asked these
poor wretches how they could possibly sleep on a bed of torture of
this kind, but they have always assured me, laughing, that they
could rest better there than on the bare ground. As a general rule
no one places any pillow under his head, not even as much as a
stone; but the natives cover themselves with a shirt, if indeed
they have one; in this garment they envelope the whole head, and if
any one, in fact, neglect covering his head at night, he will
experience a sensation of heaviness and indisposition in the
morning, which will continue during the whole day. Breakfast is not
customary in this country. Although the coffee from Abyssinia, and
even from Yemen, which stands in commercial connexion with
Kordofan, is very cheap, this beverage is but little known and is
only drank by some few djelabi and the Turkish residents of
Kordofan; with the exception of one coffee-house at Lobeid, there
is no establishment of the kind in the whole province, and this
single <em>café</em> is frequented by the Turks solely, and not by
the natives. Among the most respectable Dongolavi, however, some
few may be occasionally found who do not abstain<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> altogether from this beverage.
If a foreigner visit an influential person in the morning a pipe
and merissa are offered him, and a dish, reckoned a great delicacy,
which requires, however, a stomach differently constituted to that
of an European to digest it. I, on one occasion, had the honour of
being treated with this dish. I was one day invited by a djelabi at
Denaglé to breakfast. Having arrived at the appointed time, I was
conducted to a seat on an angareb covered with beautiful carpets,
and a pipe and merissa were handed to me. When I observed that no
fire was lighted in the fire-place and that no other preparations
were being made, I asked, without further ceremony, where the
breakfast was, for I knew very well that simple merissa would not
be considered sufficient to offer me, and I had not time to remain
longer. The djelabi told me that it would be ready immediately, and
pointed to a sheep which was running about in the court, adding,
that he would not have it slaughtered until I had arrived. I
replied, “It will soon be midday and I have other business to
attend to, and cannot wait until the meat is roasted or boiled,
especially as you have not even prepared a fire.” My host assured
me that the breakfast would be ready immediately, and that I should
have ample time to attend to my business. My curiosity was now
excited to the utmost to know with what kind of breakfast he
intended to honour me, and I kept my eyes continually on the sheep,
which was to be sacrificed in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_58">[58]</span> honour of my visit; judge, however, of my
embarrassment when a slave, on a signal from his master, quickly
decapitated the sheep, and without waiting to flay the animal,
ripped up its abdomen, took out the stomach, cleaned it, cut it
into small pieces, and laying them on a wooden dish, squeezed the
gallbladder of the animal, as we might a lemon, on the fragments,
and lastly, strewed a considerable quantity of cayenne pepper over
the whole mess. This being done, and, indeed, in an incredibly
short space of time, I was pressed to help myself quickly, before
the dish became cool; I sighed, however, and thanking my host,
begged to be excused, assuring him at the same time that an
European stomach could not possibly bear this very exquisite dish,
and that I would, therefore, content myself with looking on. He
smiled piteously at my fastidiousness, and showed evident symptoms
of relishing the delicacy. I afterwards frequently observed that
this is a very favourite dish, and was tempted, rather to satisfy
my curiosity than my appetite, to partake of it; and really the
flavour is not very disagreeable, for the gall in combination with
the cayenne takes away the odour and taste of the raw paunch,
nevertheless I could never eat a sufficient quantity of it to
satisfy the demands of hunger. Not only in Kordofan, but in
Sennaar, and Abyssinia, also, this dish is considered, as I have
before observed, a great delicacy.</p>

<p>The duties the inhabitants have to perform<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_59">[59]</span> during the day require very little
trouble, and in no country have I seen as much indolence as in
Kordofan. Every man, be his means ever so small, endeavours to
purchase a slave, and this poor wretch must then do all the work,
in order that his master may lie all day long in the shade,
indulging in idleness. The natives never perform any more labour
than is absolutely necessary, and thus much only when it is
urgently required. Those who attend to agriculture have very little
trouble or care in their employment; for they have nothing to do
but to sow the seed at a certain season, and to carry the harvest
in three months’ time. Very few persons occupy themselves with
handicraft. The houses are repaired, or renovated, at the utmost
every three or five years; thus no one has anything to do, and the
natives are consequently seen lying about sleeping all the day
long. The women attend, indeed, to the domestic duties, but these
are inconsiderable, and if their means will permit it, they pass
the greater part of the day on the angareb. The men have no
amusements; only very few of the Dongolavi smoke tobacco, but the
negro tribes indulge the more in this habit. They take little or no
interest in the dances of the women, and when they are tired of
lying down, and have slept to their hearts’ content, a few
neighbours congregate; and after greetings and mutual inquiries
into the state of their health,—a ceremony which generally occupies
a quarter of an hour,—the conversation at the most turns upon the
governor and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
casheffs, or they talk of their sick camels or asses. Politics in
general are a very small trouble to them; the taxes, however, which
they are forced to pay several times in the year, cause them a few
days of great uneasiness. On these occasions they consult together
how they may best collect them; and if the harvest was successful,
and merissa consequently plentiful, many a bitter hour is drowned
with this liquor. Their conversation becomes then more animated,
they console themselves with providence, and the rhababa, a lyre
with five strings, entirely dissipates their cares. This instrument
is their chief amusement, they will listen for hours to its
monotonous notes, and it forms a frequent accompaniment to the
voice; but story tellers who relate tales from the Arabian Nights
are not to be met with among them as in Egypt. However noisy their
amusements may become, or whatever the effects of the merissa may
be, they seldom or never proceed to quarrels. Swearing and abusive
language is scarcely ever heard among them as it is among the
Arabs, and if, as a very rare occurrence, a quarrel ever arise, it
is immediately arranged by the elders present. They never fall to
blows, although they may, perhaps, occasionally pull each other
about by the shirts. They are hospitable, and every one who
casually passes by whilst they are amusing themselves is considered
their guest, and must participate in the amusements.</p>

<p>Among the Dongolavi, I found a very singular<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> custom prevalent for settling
their affairs of honour, as they are termed; these are, generally,
disputes arising from love, or jealousy, at which the young
unmarried men have taken mortal offence; the married, who certainly
have better cause for duelling, never proceed to such extremities;
they are far more tolerant on the like occasions, and not very
particular about such trifling affairs. The young men, on the other
hand, take these things far more to heart; when, therefore, the
friends have not been able to adjust the quarrel, a formal
challenge is sent. The duel takes place in an open space, in
presence of all their friends and comrades, who act as seconds, or
rather as umpires. An angareb is placed in the middle of the field
of battle: the two combatants strip, and, binding their shirts
round their loins, each man places his foot close to the edge of
the couch, the breadth of which simply separates them from each
other. A whip, made of one solid thong of the hide of the
hippopotamus, is handed to each, and attempts to reconcile them are
again resumed. If both parties, however, prove obstinate, or their
sense of honour be too deeply implicated, for either to yield, the
signal of battle is at last given. He who is entitled to the first
blow, now inflicts a severe lash on the body of his adversary, who
instantly returns the compliment, and thus the conflict is kept up,
blow for blow, with great regularity. The head must not be struck.
The manner in which they lacerate each<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_62">[62]</span> other is perfectly frightful; for the blows
are dealt with the utmost severity, and the weapon is sufficiently
formidable to cause an immense ecchymosis with the very first
stripe,—with the third or fourth blow the blood begins to flow most
copiously. Not the slightest expression of pain is uttered by
either party, and the umpires remain cool spectators of the scene.
Thus the duellists persevere with their barbarous cruelty, until
the one or the other, overcome with pain, or exhausted with
fatigue, throws down his whip, whereupon the victor does the same,
and both shake hands, in sign of mutual satisfaction. Their
comrades now rend the air with their exclamations of joy, and
congratulate them on their reconciliation; their lacerated backs
are washed with water, and the affair terminates with a copious
libation of merissa, sundry jugs of which had been provided
beforehand for the occasion.</p>

<p>Similar causes sometimes give rise to another species of duel,
far more dangerous in its consequences than the latter, for it
frequently terminates with an injury, the effects of which are felt
during life, or even with the loss of the use of a limb. The
combatants, on this occasion, are also divided by an angareb; but,
in dealing out their alternate blows, they pay no attention to the
part they fall upon, whether the face, or any other sensitive
portion of the body, and thus severe injuries are always the
result. These duels are, however, rare, and mortal quarrels are
generally fought out in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_63">[63]</span> the manner above described. The girl, who had
been the cause of all this broil and warfare, is not drawn into the
affair, but is generally considered innocent, or pitied as
seduced.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the women are far more industrious than the
men; for, besides attending to their domestic occupations, they
employ themselves more especially with plaiting straw-mats, making
baskets to hold milk, and funnels for filtering merissa. They
perform, moreover, other business, which should more properly be
considered as the duty of the men. I have even seen them tanning
leather, whilst their husbands were quietly looking on, smoking
their pipes, and indulging in idleness.</p>

<p>The women are, generally speaking, regarded as servants. Their
degradation is yet greater, if they should unfortunately happen not
to have children. In this case they are quite despised by their
lords, if they were ever so fond of them before, and the husband
indemnifies himself with a female slave. Should this woman bear him
a child, which is generally the case, she is immediately raised to
the rank of his wife, and his former spouse is either sent away, or
totally neglected. Among the more opulent natives, the custom
prevails of making the wife a small allowance after the birth of
the second child, and giving her a separate hut as a place of
residence; for they grow old very rapidly, and a woman in her
twenty-fourth year is considered <i>passée</i>. Hence it is that
many women may be seen running<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_64">[64]</span> about as if deranged to consult their
Sheikhs,<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a> or fortune-tellers. The information these
impostors give is, of course, always agreeable to the desires of
the client, but is, generally speaking, utterly false.</p>

<p>The women of Kordofan are very merry; they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_65">[65]</span> may be heard singing, or laughing, all day
long; and chaunt over their work, either singly, or in company. As
soon as the labours of the day are ended, the girls and neighbours
congregate together, and dancing commences, an amusement generally
kept up till past midnight. They are, in fact, passionately
addicted to this recreation. If they have even been employed during
the whole day with the most onerous labour, sufficient to fatigue a
strong man, all symptoms of weariness immediately disappear when
the wood-fires are lighted before the huts in the evening, and the
sound of the Dar’abook’keh<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is heard. This is, in
fact, the signal for old and young to leave their houses, and
hasten to the scene of amusement, where the men, with their wives,
lay themselves down in a circle, and become spectators, or, joining
in the song, beat the time with their hands, while the girls now
make their appearance, and singly begin the dance.</p>

<p>This dance is very simple in its nature, requires, however,
great muscular exertion, and would prove a very difficult task for
some of our fair countrywomen. The black beauties commence their
evolutions by moving slowly, but frequently, in a small space.
Whilst beating time with their feet, they throw their heads back at
measured intervals, and draw their shoulders up; so that they
frequently even bend their bodies backwards until their heads touch
the ground. This is done with so much muscular<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_66">[66]</span> effort, that it is scarcely possible to
believe a girl of slender build could possess sufficient power of
muscle. The movements are, at first, all very slow, but gradually
increase in rapidity, and become, at last, so frequent and quick,
that you could almost imagine yourself looking at an automaton
moving on springs and wires, and not on a human being. When a girl
has nearly danced herself to death, she modestly retires to the
background, and a second takes her place. If one of them
particularly distinguish herself, and the company wish to pay her a
very great compliment, she is desired to stand forth, and a sword
is flourished several times over her head. During this ceremony,
the music is silenced, but becomes the more noisy afterwards, and
is intended as a kind of musical honour to the <i>danseuse</i>.
This compliment is generally paid her by her admirer or by a
stranger present. The natives are always delighted if a stranger
will attend their dances, offer him the best place, and treat him
with abundance of merissa. Married women, and those more advanced
in age, scarcely ever dance; they are mere spectators, or pass the
time in a different manner, more agreeably to themselves; they
form, namely, <i>comme chez nous</i>, very polite <i>côteries</i>
for scandal, where the neighbour who happens to be brought on the
<i>tapis</i> is by no means spared, for they leave no hair of his
head untouched. The married women, again, are those who pay the
least attention to the seventh commandment,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_67">[67]</span> a crime which is considered very heinous
according to the Mahommedan laws; the girls, on the other hand, are
far more moral. In some parts of Kordofan, the men consider it a
great honour if their wives have several admirers, but the
difference exists, in this country, that the ladies court the
men.</p>

<p>The dress of both men and women is very simple, for only the
Dongolavi, the wealthiest of all the tribes, wear long shirts with
wide sleeves, and a táckeéyeh,<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> or small white cap, with a
white shawl on their heads, like the turban of the Turks; red caps
are but rarely seen, nor is the táckeéyeh white longer than one
day, for it soon becomes, with dirt and grease, as black as the
owner. All the other tribes are nearly naked; they bind simply a
cotton cloth round their loins, throwing one end of it over one
shoulder; they wear no covering to their heads, but let their hair
grow as long as they please, or braid it in from ten to sixteen
plaits, which, however, never reach their backs. Every man carries
a double-edged dagger in a sheath on his left arm, and a few charms
sewn up in red leather, which the fakéers write and sell to them.
On journeys, they wear long double-edged swords, in leathern
sheaths, suspended by a short strap from the left shoulder; the
hilts of these sabres have no guards, and are merely covered with
leather. The sheikhs, however, bear<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_68">[68]</span> swords with massive silver hilts, terminating
in a knob as large as a hen’s egg of the same metal; some of them
ornament the sheaths with agates, or imitations of precious stones
in glass. The men carry large oval shields on their backs made of
the skin of the antelope, when on a march. They also carry a number
of spears, or javelins, contained in a rude leathern quiver hanging
from their shoulders. Short tours are performed on asses; longer
journeys on camels or dromedaries. The peasants who possess no
camels travel short distances on oxen.</p>

<p>The dress of the women does not differ from that of the men of
the lower orders, for they also wear a large cotton cloth bound
round their loins, part of which is thrown over one shoulder. When
they walk out they sometimes cover their heads with this cloth,
but, whilst at work, they wind the whole of it round their loins.
These melayeh, as they are termed, are at first white, then proceed
through various gradations of colour, until they lastly become
black, for they are seldom washed. In washing they make use of the
bark of a tree called Egelit, instead of soap, and spread the linen
on a piece of tanned leather, which is laid in a deep hole in the
sand. The melayeh of the Dongolavi is washed with soap, and is
generally decorated with a broad red border. It is also adjusted
with a certain degree of care, in order to give their dress a more
picturesque appearance. The women wear no covering on their heads,
but roll their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> hair
into curls, smearing them well with butter or oil made of
sim-sim.<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a> They anoint the skin of the whole body with a
pomatum prepared of spikenard,<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> mahleb,<a id=
"FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
and tuffer;<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a> these ingredients, rubbed down upon a stone,
are called “telka.” The oils and butter give the hair a certain
gloss, as long as it is free from dust; but the pomatum on the head
soon becomes rancid, when it is impossible to remain long in
proximity of one of these beauties, without offence to the
olfactory nerves. Their eyelids are covered with powdered
antimony.<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a> Women who pride themselves on their head-dress,
and do not wish to discompose their curls, make use of a small
wooden bench, about a span in height, and hollowed out above, so as
to admit the neck, as a pillow when they lie down to sleep, in
order to avoid pressing their curls. It is the most incommodious
pillow in the world, but the women, to gratify vanity, accustom
themselves to it, as the slave becomes inured to his fetters, and
sleep very well, notwithstanding the uncomfortable position they
are obliged to adopt. An idea may be formed of the hardship they
have at first to undergo, in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_70">[70]</span> considering that this position does not admit
of the slightest change during sleep; but as our belles willingly
allow their ribs to be uncomfortably compressed by a tight corset
to appear with a small waist, thus the women of Kordofan
voluntarily submit to this torture to preserve their head-dress.
The toilette of these children of nature requires, moreover, a much
longer time than that of our European ladies, for the number of
curls which are matted together with oil and grease and dust, until
they form one dense mass, demand considerable time for their
dressing. As they have no combs, scissors, pincers, hair-pins, or
other implements of <i>coiffure</i>, one simple wooden peg answers
the purpose of all these instruments, and we may easily imagine
that a great deal of time is spent in arranging the hundreds of
curls of their woolly hair. The women wear rings in their noses and
ears, mostly of silver and brass, for those of gold have totally
disappeared, or have become, at least, very rare. Several of them,
indeed, wear bracelets and rings of silver round their ankles, the
latter decorated with small pieces of coral or small bells. The
greater part of the bracelets worn are of horn or of ivory,
frequently two inches in breadth, and the anklets are mostly of
copper, sometimes even as much as one pound in weight. Round their
necks and heads the women wind strings of beads of Bohemian glass;
the favourite colour is dark blue. Some of the ladies hang small
round plates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> of gold,
an inch in diameter, on their foreheads, or small round pieces of
amber of the same size. On their fingers they wear silver rings set
with cornelians. They are, in fact, fond of anything that shines or
glitters, and has a bright or gaudy colour, and it is no easy
matter, at times, to abstain from laughter, on beholding one of
these black beauties in full dress. I have, frequently, on the
other hand, met with others who dressed themselves with peculiar
taste, so that they really presented an agreeable appearance. Women
who are not wealthy wear small pearls, or small red berries, or a
charm sewn up in red leather on their foreheads. On their arms they
carry ivory or horn bracelets; round their ankles copper rings or a
large milk-white glass bead; round their necks they hang strings of
blue glass beads, and in their noses and ears rings of brass. The
unmarried or girls walk about naked, and bind only round their
loins a fringed leathern belt, from which several hundred small
thin straps depend. This girth is called “rahat,” and is frequently
decorated with agates. They are, also, very fond of ornament, and
adorn their heads and necks with glass beads. The boys run about in
a perfect state of nudity up to their twelfth year. The men anoint
their bodies, like the women, with oil, butter, and other greasy
substances, not so much for the purpose of giving the skin a glossy
appearance, as to preserve it from cracking, to which inconvenience
it would be very liable,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_72">[72]</span> as they walk about uncovered, exposing
themselves to a scorching heat. The covering to the feet consists
of sandals of undressed leather bound with straps; the Dongolavi,
however, wear sandals of tanned leather, decorated with coloured
straps. On journeys, some of the natives wear sheepskin, after the
same fashion as the miners<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of Germany a leather
behind them, to avoid sitting down naked on the burning ground.</p>

<p>Slaves are met with in nearly every house: the female portion is
employed in domestic work, the male in agricultural labour; they
receive once a year, at the feast of the great Baëram, a piece of
cotton stuff; which wound round their loins constitutes their whole
clothing. They are treated very well, and, in most families,
partake of the same fare as their masters. The badge of servitude
is, however, not wanting; for the male slaves are generally bound
in fetters, applied to their legs, to prevent them from running
away. I never saw one of these<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_73">[73]</span> beings illtreated by his master for doing too
little work; it is only when they make an attempt to run away, that
they are beaten. The female slaves run at liberty, and unfettered;
they are also treated with more lenity, especially if they should
happen to be young and pretty, or when the master admits them to
the rights of a wife. The children, born by these slaves, are the
property of the owner, who may sell them; this is, however, no
longer the case in Egypt, where all natural children are treated
like Egyptians. These poor creatures have equal cause to complain
of their masters, as some slave-proprietors make this a branch of
commerce; thus they are mostly mustered after a few years, and sold
to slave-merchants, who take them down to Grand Cairo. Europeans
must be very careful in purchasing female slaves, and ought
especially to be on their guard against those who speak Arabic
well, for many of them are acquainted with all kinds of tricks.
Many slaves, on the other hand, are not to be purchased from their
proprietors, especially if they are well taught; and only when they
have not adopted the faith of Islam, and die, are they treated like
cattle. These children of nature frequently behave in the most
singular manner when they take an object that is unknown to them
into their hands; it would, indeed, make any man laugh heartily to
see how awkwardly they comport themselves. A very comical instance
of the kind occurred to me: a girl, who<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> was suffering from head-ache, begged a cloth
of me to bind round her head, and I lent her my flag,<a id=
"FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
as I had nothing else at hand. I visited her on the next day,
thinking to find her ill at home, but was told that she was much
better, and had gone out. My astonishment at meeting the handsome
girl, in company with several of her friends, on the market-place,
decked out with my flag in the form of a woman’s frock, may be
easily imagined; and my laughter was greatly increased, at
observing the double-headed eagle expanded in full glory over the
centre of her body. Several Turks, who were present, were likewise
attacked with fits of laughter; but the <i>belle</i>, and her
friends, found this decoration so pretty, that I was besieged with
entreaties to present them also with like <i>fantasias</i>; and I
was obliged to use all possible means to persuade them, and make
them understand, that I possessed no more articles of ornament of
this description, and that I must even take this one back. The
handsome girls were, as may be supposed, by no means pleased with
this measure, for I had a great deal of trouble in getting my flag
back to hoist it in its place in proper time.</p>

<p>The food consists chiefly of dokn bread, assida,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> and woika. The dokn, having been
ground on a stone to flour, is put into an earthen pot, and
converted, by means of water, into a thin paste. A fire is now
lighted under an earthen-dish (or under an iron-plate, called
doga), which stands on three stones; when the dish is heated, it is
greased with butter, and the paste is spread upon it in the shape
and size of an ordinary cake. The one side being baked, the bread
is turned, and the dish again greased with butter. These cakes are
about the thickness of a finger, and for Europeans very
indigestible; they distend the stomach, indeed, awfully; an effect
produced by the corn, partly because the husks are not separated
from the flour, partly because the bread is not well baked. Those
who are more wealthy, consume a better kind of bread, which has
also a more pleasant flavour; the flour is purified, and the paste
more fluid; it is spread upon the dish by means of a small brush,
but otherwise prepared in the same manner as the former variety.
Much time is required to bake the necessary quantity for the
consumption of the house. More than one hour is spent in making
bread enough of the latter description to serve two persons at
dinner. Fresh bread must, therefore, be prepared every day; and it
is always made by the women; for, as there is no mill in Kordofan,
every one is obliged to grind the quantity of flour necessary for
his consumption daily. This is done, as I have already observed, by
female slaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>The assida and
woika are the common dishes of the natives of Kordofan. The former
consists of flour, boiled after the fashion of the Italian
polenta<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class=
"fnanchor">[30]</a>; but there is a considerable difference in the
mode of preparing this mess; for the poorer class use the flour in
its natural state, whereas the wealthy natives have it several
times washed in water, a process rendering it much whiter and
purer. Woika is prepared in the following manner:—The natives take
pieces of beef, dried in the sun, cut for the purpose into long
slips, of the thickness of a finger, which form in every family a
part of the household stores. This is reduced with dried
bamié<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a> to a coarse powder in a wooden mortar. Some
onions are now burnt with butter in an earthen-pot, over which
water is poured. When the stock boils, one person stirs it up,
whilst another gradually adds the pounded meat and bamié, until it
forms a thick mass. This ragout, or currie, is then poured into the
assida before described, and served up; it has a pleasant flavour,
is very nutritious, and far more wholesome than any other kind of
animal food. A great deal of meat is consumed; for it is very
cheap, and nearly every one keeps goats and sheep. The Turks,
indeed, do not eat the beef, nor is it to be recommended to
Europeans, for it is very indigestible,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_77">[77]</span> and of ill flavour. The oock’ckah,<a id=
"FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
of two pounds and three quarters, does not cost more than twenty
paras (twopence); and it is sold in the market-place of Lobeid
without the bones. In the country, it is retailed at half this
amount; and the price of the piece bargained for is fixed, without
weighing it, by judging by the eye alone. There is no deficiency of
fowls, pigeons, and various species of gazelles; these, however,
are luxuries which are only to be met with in the houses of the
wealthy, and on festive occasions. Every family dines at midday;
the men are first served; and when they have finished their meal,
the women and children sit down. A straw-mat is spread upon the
sand, in the centre of which a wooden dish is placed, containing
assida and woika; while the necessary bread is served up on a flat
straw-dish. Every one present in the hut, the family as well as
strangers, for no invitation is required, sit down, with their legs
bent under them, on the straw-mat round the dish; and, on being
invited by the master of the house with the word, Bishmillah (in
the name of God) to help themselves, all plunge their hands at the
same time into the dish. Each person now takes as much as he can
hold in his five fingers, and conveys it to his mouth. The bread is
generally eaten at the same<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_78">[78]</span> time; and thus they proceed, taking one
handful after the other, until the dish is emptied of the last
morsel. If a stranger cease to eat first, the master of the house
invites him to continue, not as a matter of ceremonious courtesy,
but in true kindness. During dinner little is spoken, for each
individual endeavours above all things to satisfy hunger. In the
villages, curds and bread are served up in the dish at meals. The
poorer class have not always assida, but the woika alone, and bread
and milk. When the contents of a dish are coming to an end, one man
rises after the other. The master of the house receives no thanks,
nor does he, indeed, expect them; for it is regarded as an
understood thing, that every one must be satisfied who happens to
be present at the time of the meals. They wash their hands before,
and after eating, and the same ablution is performed in the evening
at sun-set.</p>

<p>During the dinner, water is only handed round in gourds to
drink; when the meal is over the merissa is served up. This
description of beer is met with in all the villages of Kordofan
with but few exceptions; and even among the nomadic tribes, it is
seldom missing, except, indeed, when the harvest has been
particularly unsuccessful. Merissa is brewed in the following
manner:—the dokn forms the chief basis: it is allowed to germinate
first, as the barley in Germany, dried in the sun, and then bruised
between stones. Cakes of bread are now made, placed in a pot and
covered with water, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_79">[79]</span> when this liquor has sufficiently
fermented,—a process requiring two days,—it is filtered through a
sieve formed of rushes. This merissa must be drunk immediately, for
with the third day it begins to turn acid, a result which is not to
be wondered at considering the intense heat of the climate, for
they have no cellars in which they could preserve it for any length
of time. The same merissa repeatedly filtered until it has become
clearer is called <em>bill-bill</em>; but <em>bill-bill</em>
prepared with sugar, nutmeg, cloves, and other optional drugs forms
<em>sansugot</em>. The latter beverage is made in various ways. It
is an agreeable drink and very cooling. As a rule it is far more
conducive to health to drink a larger quantity of merissa than of
water in this climate, and I advise travellers in particular to
observe this prescription, the more so as I found by experience
that, as soon as I discontinued water, and commenced drinking
merissa and brandy, the fever and dysentery, of which I could not
get rid before, left me. I have also known natives, who, confining
themselves to merissa, never drank one drop of water throughout the
year, and these men were, without exception, the healthiest;
whereas the water-drinkers were always attacked with fever during
the rainy season.</p>

<p>In those districts, where the inhabitants occupy themselves with
agriculture, as at the foot of Mount Kordofan, merissa flows in
great abundance, and the greater part of the men are, consequently,
in a state of intoxication all the year round, for they never
take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> the vessel
containing it from their mouths from early in the morning until
late at night. In Lobeid, and in many villages, there are houses
for the sale of merissa, where this beverage is served by very
pretty girls, who are also excellent dancers, and thus attract many
guests. They are, moreover, so very acute that you might believe
them to have been brought up, or at least to have received a
lesson, in one of the capitals of Europe. Mehemed Ali, a few years
ago, put down public prostitution in Egypt, and some of the
refugees found an asylum in Kordofan and Sennaar. When the governor
or other Turks give a <i>fête</i>, they always engage some of these
able performers to amuse their guests. They come accompanied by a
clown, and besides their original dances give plastic
representations which, be they ever so trifling or even offensive
against the mahommedan law, afford much pleasure. I saw travesties
of this kind performed in presence of the governor, in which the
government and its respective functionaries were faithfully
portrayed, and affairs were represented such as too frequently
occur in reality; but no offence is ever taken at these plays,
they, on the contrary, only increase the laughter of those who feel
themselves hit.</p>

<p>Brandy is distilled at Lobeid only, from dates imported from
Dongola: the natives are very fond of it, but it is too expensive
an enjoyment for them to indulge in to intoxication, or to drink
instead of merissa; for the bottle costs nine piasters or
fifty-four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> cruitzers
(equal to about two shillings and sixpence). The wealthy
inhabitants, therefore, and the Turkish officers only drink brandy.
Festivals like those kept in Egypt are not known in Kordofan, for
the natives in general are not sufficiently wealthy to spend large
sums on the like amusements, and it is not, moreover, customary to
give feasts at marriages, circumcisions, and other occasions of
this kind. If a man be about to marry, he goes straightways to the
father of the bride he has selected, and before exchanging a word
with her concludes the contract, determining the allowance he
proposes to make to his future wife.</p>

<p>The marriage portion consists either in money, oxen, sheep,
goats, or other articles of domestic economy, and is at the same
time the property of the woman, although she may be shortly
divorced from her husband. Marriages are contracted with very
little ceremony, for as soon as the bridegroom has agreed with the
father of the bride on the bargain, he takes the woman of his
choice home, hews the rahat, or fringed virginal girdle with a
knife in innumerable pieces, covers her with a melayeh as a sign
that she is now his wife, and the ceremony thus terminates. The
nearest neighbours are at the most invited to a dinner; merissa is
served up, and the whole affair is concluded with the customary
dances. If the bride belong to one of the tribes who practise
circumcision, she is certainly forced to subject herself to a fresh
operation twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> days
before her marriage. When a woman is ill-treated by her husband, or
there exists any other cogent reason, she requests to be divorced
from him, and the separation is effected without the slightest
difficulty. She takes her marriage portion, and if there be
children, the girls away with her, whilst the boys remain with the
father. A separation is, however, frequently insisted upon without
any good cause, for if the husband does not make his wife a
sufficient allowance of telka,<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> she may sue for a divorce.
Many men separate from their wives when they begin to age, as they
generally do after the birth of the second child, and marry a
second time with a young girl. To these cast-off wives a tukkoli is
then accorded, and a maintenance sufficient to keep them,
consisting generally of twenty paras, little more than three
halfpence daily. The rich of course are only able to follow this
custom, one man, however, scarcely ever has more than two wives in
lawful wedlock; but every one keeps a number of female slaves as
concubines, especially when his wives begin to grow old. They do
not pay much attention to those clauses in matrimony, prescribed by
the mahommedan religion, and to which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_83">[83]</span> the Moslemins rigidly adhere. The birth of a
child is attended with little or no festivity, and the husband pays
but slight attention to his wife during this critical period, for
every one knows that labours are mostly natural, and terminate
quickly and successfully. A midwife and an elderly relation at the
utmost are present in the hut with the parturient woman, and when
the child is born, a drink, consisting of soda, dried dates, and
milk, which is very cooling, or water only, is offered to the
mother. On the second, frequently even on the first day, the woman
leaves her bed and goes about her ordinary occupations. Parents are
very fond of their children, and are never known to beat them for
any error they may have committed. The care and education of the
young is left entirely to the mother; until they have attained a
more mature age, the father troubles himself but little about his
children. When a mother weans her child—children at the breast are,
however, frequently fed with bread soaked in water—and it has
attained the age of one year, it may be seen with an onion in its
little hands, gnawing it with as much pleasure as our European
children evince in sucking preparations of sugar. Wild fruits are
also given to them, and yet the children are for the most part
healthy and strong, with this one exception, that they all, up to a
certain age, have protuberant abdomina, a consequence of feeding
them on bread, which causes distention even in grown-up persons.
Whilst the children are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_84">[84]</span> very young, they are laid in cradles, or
rather hammocks, consisting of a cotton cloth, attached with cords
by its four ends to a beam.</p>

<p>Circumcision is generally performed according to the custom of
the Moslems, between the fourth and sixth year. I also met with
some few tribes, where circumcision of the female was practised;
this, however, is a popular custom, totally unconnected with
religious rites, and is probably intended to prove to the
bridegroom, who is about to marry, that the girl is a virgin,—a
circumstance to which these tribes attach much importance. The
Turks, and others, have a peculiar ceremony on the occasion of
their marriage festivals, by which the bridegroom, on the day of
his marriage, convinces himself of the virginity of his bride; but
this test is liable to fallacy, which is not possible with
circumcision. The operation of circumcision<a id=
"FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
is performed on girls when they are five, or, at the utmost, seven
years of age, and is attended with festivities, for which no
expense is shunned; it constitutes, indeed, a festival, against
which the poorer people begin to save money a year before it takes
place, that nothing may be wanting to add to its celebration. From
four to eight days before the period of circumcision they dance and
sing all day long until late at night; but on the actual day of the
operation, the dancing<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_85">[85]</span> and singing is kept up during the whole
night. Professional performers are hired for the occasion, merissa
is distributed, in short, everything is done to afford amusement to
the poor victim, and to induce her to forget the bitter moment
which awaits her. When the important hour arrives, all the men are
turned out of the hut; but the mother, and a few women, remain with
the girl, partly to hold her during the operation, partly to
encourage her to bear it with fortitude. The patient is now
stretched upon an angareb, and the women surrounding her grasp her
feet, arms, head, and body firmly, so that she cannot move; an
elderly matron then approaches with a common razor, and performs
the operation. At this moment, both those within the hut, and those
without, become merry to ecstacy; they applaud until their hands
burn with clapping; the dara’book’keh is beaten until the skin is
ready to burst; and the singers exert their voices to the utmost,
with deafening eagerness, in order to drown the cries of pain of
the little sufferer, which, nevertheless, penetrate through all
this noise. The incision is performed from below upwards, and
removes the external organs of the girl. Hæmorrhage is stopped with
butter, the bark of a tree, beaten into fine fibre, is laid into
the wound, instead of lint, and a piece of wood, about the size of
a quill, is inserted, to prevent its edges from adhering together.
The great toe of each foot is then firmly tied together, and in
this extended position<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_86">[86]</span> the little patient has to lie for twenty long
days on an angareb. During this period, very little is given her to
drink, and she is lifted out of bed, at the most twice, daily. The
wound generally heals successfully; but it frequently happens that
a girl has to undergo a second operation two years after the first,
or a little later, for they marry in this country at an early
age.</p>

<p>When the bridegroom has concluded the marriage contract with the
father,<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a> (...) The second operation is now performed,
which the girl bears with more patience, as she enters on a married
life immediately after she has recovered from her sufferings.
Twenty days are on this occasion required for the cure; whereupon
the bridegroom, as I before mentioned, hues the rahat of the girl
into pieces, and dresses his bride with the melayéh.</p>

<p>Another operation, which is quite as painful, and infinitely
more revolting, is performed on the young male slaves, who are
intended for the guards of the harems of the Turks, and other
moslems. A sheikh at Lobeid, named Sultan Tehmé,<a id=
"FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
performs this operation. Boys of eight, or nine years of age, are
generally brought to him for mutilation. The operation is performed
in his court, where the poor victim is stretched upon the ground
like a head of cattle.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_87">[87]</span> Sacks, filled with sand, are laid upon his
feet and chest, which are so heavy that the poor boy can scarcely
breathe beneath their weight. With one incision, with a common
razor, the organs of generation of the unfortunate being are
removed; hæmorrhage is arrested with melted butter, and the bark of
a tree, beaten into fibre, is then laid as dressing on the wound,
while a piece of lead, of the size of a quill, is inserted into the
urethra, to keep that necessary passage open. The patient remains
twenty days under treatment, at the expiration of which term, he is
returned to his master. More than one half of these unfortunate
boys die under the operation, or during their march to Egypt, for
very few of them ever reach the place of their destination. The
price of these eunuchs is, consequently, generally double that of a
common slave. The operator receives ten reals, at fifteen piasters,
for each operation. Two boys are also frequently given to the
mutilator, the one of which must be returned to the owner, whilst
he keeps the other in lieu of payment. Castrates are, indeed, made
in Sennaar, and Upper Egypt; but those of Lobeid are in greater
request.</p>

<p>The death of a native is immediately made known by the cry of
“Lu, lu, lu, lu!” which the women set up, bringing the notes out
separately at certain intervals, and resting upon them with their
voice. Not only the mourners, but all the women, who happen to be
present at the time, join in the dismal dirge. This lamentation is
continued until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
sun-set, and repeated on the following day. The corpse is then
washed, wrapped in a white cotton cloth, if his means were adequate
to the expense, and is carried on a stretcher to the place of
sepulture, and there interred. His widows mourn always in company
with their female friends, until their grief is allayed,—a result
which requires a few days only, especially if they be young, and
pretty, and wish to marry again. This mode of mourning is not only
customary where the deceased was a grown-up person; but if a child,
a few days old, die, it is honoured with the same ceremony during a
few days. The negro women are very susceptible, both to pain and
pleasure; and I have frequently, on these occasions, seen them
writhing, as if beside themselves, in the sand, biting their arms,
until the blood flowed in sincere grief, and not for outward
show.</p>

<p>There are certain districts in Kordofan, the agricultural
population of which inhabit two different villages in the year; for
even in several of the most fertile tracts of land, water is at
times entirely wanting, more especially during the dry season.
Whole villages, therefore, are frequently necessitated to reinstate
themselves in localities a few miles distant from their former
place of residence, where they find wells. The whole of their
domestic utensils will not overload an ox, hence an emigration of
this nature is quickly effected, and without much difficulty. Those
tribes who occupy themselves with the tillage of land, possess but
few horses or camels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
but a more considerable number of oxen, sheep, and goats. The oxen
are broken in for riding and carrying loads. In some villages the
herds of horned cattle are very considerable. When the herds of a
village are driven out, the drover either rides before or after
them on an ox; each animal has its peculiar name, by which the
herdsman recalls it, if it stray to either side or remain behind
the drove. The animals quickly hear his voice, understand it well,
and are very obedient to his command. If a head of cattle stray too
far from the herd, and do not hear his call, he rides after it, and
brings it back without any difficulty. These herdsmen ride very
well, and it is a matter of astonishment to see them going along at
full gallop on a very young ox. They ride on the bare back of the
animal, with a cord passed through the nose of the beast, answering
the purpose of a bit. In many villages in isolated situations, far
distant from other habitations, where the cattle, therefore, cannot
easily stray and become mixed with other herds, there are no
drovers, but when the cows have been milked in the morning the
enclosures are opened, and the whole herd is let out. They all
proceed straightways to a well, where they are watered in troughs,
hollowed out of the trunks of trees, and when they have finished
drinking and are all collected together, an old ox taking the lead,
shows them the way and the whole drove follows him. It is
astonishing how accurately they follow their leader, who frequently
conducts them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> a
pasture situated at a distance of two hours’ march from the
village, and brings them all safely back again. The most remarkable
part of the affair, however, is that they always re-assemble at the
well punctually at half an hour before sunset, whether they have
been one mile or eight miles distant. I observed this fact at the
village of Ledet, where I met the cattle at a distance of eight
miles from the huts, and, to my great astonishment, saw no
herdsman. On my arrival in the village I asked what this meant, and
was told that it had been the custom from time immemorial, to allow
the cattle to go unattended to pasture in this village, as it is in
many others; and that an animal very rarely strayed. In order to be
the better able to look after a beast which might possibly be lost,
a circumstance, however, of very rare occurrence, it is only
necessary to observe the direction the herd takes in wandering out
in the morning. I was told that, a few months before my arrival, a
cow belonging to this place was missing when the herd returned. As
the animal did not come back in the night, the owner mounted a
camel with the first dawn of day, provided himself with a supply of
bread and water sufficient for four days, and rode out in the
direction the cattle had taken on the former day. Having arrived at
the place of pasture he traversed it in all directions, until he
came upon the track of a camel and a cow, which he followed up
during two whole days, until it brought him to an encampment of the
Kubbabeesh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> where he
found his lost cow alive; nor did he experience the slightest
difficulty about its restitution. The cows are milked throughout
the country twice daily, once in the morning at sunrise, and again
in the evening, but they yield very little milk, which in an hour’s
time turns sour and thick. The baskets made of rushes, into which
the cows are milked, can never be washed thoroughly clean, and are
probably the chief cause of the deterioration of the milk; it is
consequently impossible to keep it for any length of time. Butter
is quickly made, and without any difficulty. As soon as the
necessary quantity of milk is obtained it is put into leathern
bags, which are fastened to a piece of wood, and shaken about for
some time until the butter is ready. A small yellow fruit is
sometimes added to the milk, and greatly accelerates the
butyration.</p>

<p>In many villages a market is held once a week, when every
inhabitant must provide himself with supplies for the whole week,
as nothing is to be purchased on the intervening days; this rule
applies more especially to tobacco, an article of consumption which
ranks, with many natives, before food. As a proof of this assertion
I may, perhaps, be allowed to mention the following occurrence:—In
a village where a market is generally held every week, a fire broke
out and burnt the hut of an old man to the very ground. The
proprietor stood quietly looking on at a distance, and
consoled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> himself with
an exclamation of “Allah-Kerim” (God is merciful); he then
approached me, and I, expecting to hear a dismal tale, had a
trifling present in readiness for him, but greatly was I astonished
when he refused the present, and begged of me to give him merely a
handful of tobacco, as his whole supply was consumed in the
conflagration.</p>

<p>The natives of Kordofan are a very good tempered people, and the
traveller meets everywhere with a kind and hospitable reception. If
he arrive at midday, or in the evening in a village, he has only to
choose a hut, which the inhabitant immediately quits, leaving it
entirely at the disposal of his guest. The natives content
themselves, in the meantime, with being quartered on their next
neighbours, or they will pass the whole time, if the weather permit
it, in the open air. If he do not despise their fare, he will not
have a <em>sous</em> of outlay, neither for himself, his servant,
nor for his camels, who find their food close to the village. The
inhabitants perform all the services he may require willingly, and
without the slightest contradiction, and he will hear nothing of
the “backsheesh,” so troublesome among the Egyptians. The only
custom which the stranger will find a nuisance, are the visits with
which he is honoured in great numbers soon after his arrival. The
judge, and persons of influence in the village, enter the hut,
whilst the rest encamp around it in the open air. The ceremonies
commence with greetings, and then a hundred questions are asked,
as, whence he came?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
where he is travelling to? what has befallen him on the road?
whether he have heard of any fresh war, and the like? in fact they
scarcely allow him time to breathe, and he has barely answered one
question before a hundred fresh inquiries are made. The servant has
to suffer more even than the master from their importunities; for
they endeavour to obtain all possible information indirectly from
him. They ask him who the stranger is? whether he is a person of
consideration? to which nation he belongs? and anything else, in
fact, they may deem worthy of knowing. If they hear that he is a
Frank, then the conflux becomes great indeed. All the sick persons
in the village are dragged into his presence, and he is entreated
to give advice and medicine. Protestations to the effect that he is
no medical man are of no use, for a Frank must be a hakkim, and the
stranger has no alternative left him, but to console them with the
hope of recovery through Providence, if he will not make use of
common domestic remedies. Should he have coffee and sugar served,
or at least a pipe of good tobacco, he will cause them a great
pleasure. Every man takes a few whiffs from the pipe and then hands
it to his neighbour, and thus it circulates among them. He must
not, however, imagine that, when the pipe is out and the coffee
finished, the natives will take their leave, for they become then,
on the contrary, more talkative as their bashfulness is dissipated
by his condescension. There is, in fine, no other way of getting
rid of these troublesome<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94">[94]</span> visitors than by pretending to be overcome
with sleep from weariness and fatigue. When they observe his eyes
to be shut they all rise, and leave the hut so quietly that they
are scarcely heard. Having got rid of the men the worst is not yet
over, for then come the women tormented with curiosity to see a
Frank. They assemble generally at some distance before the hut he
inhabits, and anxiously await the moment he may quit the house and
exhibit himself to them. At first they are afraid to approach, but
in a short time, or by presenting a piece of sugar to their
children, they become as familiar with him as if he had lived for
years among them. The villages situated on the road to Dongola or
Khartoom are very much plagued by the frequent marches of troops
through them, and especially with the frequent journeys of the
Turkish officers. The latter on arriving at a village, immediately
take possession of the best hut, leave the inhabitants no time to
take their few chattels away with them, but drive them out whip in
hand, and heap every species of abuse on the poor natives. All the
articles of food they require are demanded in an authoritative
tone, and if they be not immediately forthcoming they again resort
to the whip; and fowls, or pigeons, or any living thing that is not
willingly given, is shot down by the officer or his servants in the
streets before the houses. Payment is totally out of the question;
in all villages, therefore, exposed to the marches of the
Egyptians, very little poultry or other animals<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> subservient as articles of food
are to be met with; for the inhabitants keep their stock and
provisions concealed. But no sooner do they hear that the traveller
is a Frank, than they bring him everything he asks for; their
demands are very moderate, and they frequently will not accept
anything in return. They are also very attentive in procuring
everything he may require for his journey onwards; whereas the
Turks frequently have, in this respect, to suffer a deficiency of
many things. The natives of Kordofan are altogether the best
tempered people in the world, if they are but treated with common
civility, and differ widely from their neighbours in Sennaar, who
although under the same government, situate under the same degree
of latitude, and for the most part of the same race, are of totally
different disposition.</p>

<p>The villages, more especially lying on the borders of the
country, form an exception to the former rule, and are not in the
best odour with the natives themselves. The traveller should, more
particularly, be on his guard at Haraza, on the road to Dongola;
Ledet, on the road to Khartoom; and Caccia on the road to Darfour;
the last mentioned village is of all the most formidable. In
travelling through Haraza, I myself took an active part in a scene
which might have proved of very evil consequences, if my servant
had not been able to intimidate the son of the sheikh with an
excusable falsehood. At this place it is necessary to take in a
supply of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> fresh
water, because none is to be met with until beyond Ketshmar,
situate at a distance of two short days’ journey from the former
village. Persons also travelling to Dongola must furnish themselves
with water, sufficient to last them to the rocky caverns in
Semmeria, in this village. The sheikh, who considers himself the
proprietor of all the wells, will not allow water to be drawn,
except he be paid for it; and the Djelabi are forced to give him
from one to five dollars for the permission of filling their
water-bags. When I wanted water, he demanded six dollars of me,
thinking a Frank ought, of course, to pay more. He was not prepared
for any contradiction, because he saw me travelling alone with my
servant; I, however, was acquainted with these arbitrary demands,
and had been, moreover, cautioned by others not to submit to his
extortions, as he has no right to sell the water for his own
benefit, which is the property of the government. I, consequently,
refused to pay the sum he demanded with decision; and after much
talking on the one side and the other, he at last ordered water to
be given me from a well, which was so putrid that the camels even
would not drink it. When my servant mentioned this circumstance to
me, I ordered him to pour the water immediately away, and demanded
good drinkable water of the sheikh, as I knew that there were pure
wells in the neighbourhood; he, however, would not draw me any
more, not even of the bad water. I was so irritated<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> at the audacious conduct of this
man, that I drew my pistol from my belt, and, pointing it at his
breast, threatened to shoot him if he did not immediately give
orders to his people to furnish me with the quantity of water
necessary for my journey from the good wells. My servant begged of
me not to shoot; took the sheikh’s son aside, and whispered to him,
that I was not to be trusted, as I had, twelve days before, shot a
sheikh in Dongola for a similar resistance, and that I had a
perfect right, as a Frank, to slay any man who opposed himself to
my lawful demands. This <em>ruse</em> had the desired effect; and
the man, who had been before so obstinate, now humbly begged my
pardon, entreated me to go into his own residence, where the good
water I required should be sent in a very short time. This was
really done; and, in addition to the supply required, he presented
me with a fat sheep for my journey, would not receive any payment,
and shewed himself altogether very desirous of gratifying every
wish I might express.</p>

<p>This sheikh possesses several very excellent horses, broken for
hunting the giraffe, and almost all those beautiful animals sent to
Europe and America are caught by him. At the time I speak of, he
had twenty-four sons and daughters living.</p>

<p>Before undertaking a journey into Kordofan, it is essential to
understand properly the characters of the various nations
inhabiting this country, to study their dispositions well, and
treat them accordingly;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_98">[98]</span> for that which is to be effected with the one
by rigour and intimidation, can only be obtained from the other by
friendly and conciliating treatment. In the contrary case, the
worst must be feared. The negroes, especially, should be treated
with lenity and kindness; whereas, with the Arabs and Dongolavi,
severity and intimidation are necessary. In my travels, during
nineteen months in the various countries, I had to suffer more
(consequently had more experience) than those travellers who
hurried through the country, accompanied by a military escort, a
number of Ghawa’zee,<a id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a> servants, and others, whereas I had but
one single servant, and, during the latter part of my travels, was
not even attended by him. I was often forced to suffer the greatest
torments of hunger and thirst, and was, for a short time, obliged
to rest contented with locusts and putrid camels’ flesh,—bread was
quite out of the question; I even held out once for thirty-six
hours without water. As far as my eye could reach, I saw nothing
but sand and sky,—not a worm even enlivened the dismal scene; the
skeletons of men and camels lay strewn about the plains, as fitting
monuments of the surrounding misery; a hot wind raised the burning
sand, so as to darken the sun, and I expected with every step to
find my grave. One of our camel-drivers sank under the fatigue; and
the sand of the desert which rode upon the winds soon covered his
bones. On my flight from<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_99">[99]</span> Kordofan to Sennaar, sleep, during which so
many cares and troubles are forgotten, frequently failed me; and
what did I not suffer on my return home through the frightful
desert, from Abouhamed to Krusko, on the Nile! I had not the means
to purchase a second camel. My solitary beast was laden with my
luggage and water-bags; it was, indeed, overloaded, I could not,
therefore, mount it, and I was thus under the painful necessity of
following the caravan, during two tedious days on foot, enduring a
march of twenty-one hours daily on the sand, under a scorching sun.
Man overcomes many difficulties, and will bear more than is
generally believed. In eight days I reached Krusko, where I met Mr.
Kotschy, the naturalist; he alone can tell how worn out I was with
fatigue, hunger, and thirst, when I arrived at his tent, where he
entertained me during three days, for he had just arrived from
Grand Cairo.<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a> I may, therefore, say that I have been put to
many trials, endured innumerable hardships, and had many
hair-breadth escapes with my life. It is not very probable that a
traveller, furnished with a passport, would now meet with any
misadventure in the interior of the country, for the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> government is very strict; on
the borders, on the other hand, especially towards Darfour and
Takale, he may dread the worst; for who would make enquiries after
a single stranger, if he were robbed and murdered by these nomadic
tribes? should he even be missed, it would be a very extraordinary
thing if any one could come upon the track of a single individual;
for no one native would ever betray the other. It is, therefore,
very essential to study well the character of these people, and to
avoid coming into collision with them. I will mention a single
instance in illustration, which happened on the borders of the
Shilluk’s country, on the White Nile, and nearly cost me and my
servant our lives. With my knowledge of the character of the
people, and by humouring them, and thus gaining on their weak
points, I was alone able to help myself out of this embarrassment.
I pitched my tent, namely, on the shore of the Nile, and sent my
servant out in search of the wood requisite for our consumption
during the night; for it is necessary in these regions, when
encamped in the open air on the banks of the river, to keep up a
fire all night long, partly on account of the crocodiles, which
swarm in these localities and are very dangerous, partly on account
of the hippopotami; for, although the latter never do any injury,
yet they are by no means an agreeable acquaintance. Lions,
moreover, and other beasts of prey, might pay a very disagreeable
visit in the dark, and they are only to be kept at a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> respectful distance by
maintaining a fire throughout the night. Just as my servant was
about to sally forth in quest of fuel, a boat, laden with wood, and
rowed by a negro, crossed the river, and landed near my tent. My
servant immediately walked up to the negro, and demanded a quantity
of wood, as he could find none in the neighbourhood. The
good-tempered black instantly gave him the half of his store; but,
as soon as I had turned my back, my avaricious servant asked for
more, which the negro flatly refused; the former, hereupon, became
abusive, and his opponent by no means remained mute, until from
words they fell to blows, and, finally, began to fight in real
earnest. The negro, who was the better man of the two, gave my
servant a sound beating, and did not cease, until he roared out
most lustily for mercy. I observed the scuffle from the distance;
but, unacquainted with what had transpired, and merely seeing that
my servant was getting the worst of the affray, I took my
double-barrelled gun, presented it at the negro, and commanded him
to desist. He instantly sprang on his feet, seized his spear, and
threw it at me, before I was even aware of his intention; the
missile, fortunately, only grazed my wide papooshes. He was now
disarmed, and I again presented at him. The negro remained
perfectly cool, and merely said: “Shoot on! I die; and what of
that!” I now saw that nothing was to be effected by intimidation,
laid my gun aside, and, walking up to him, enquired into
all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> he
circumstances of the case, which he faithfully related. Convinced
of the injustice of my servant, I endeavoured to pacify the negro,
and assured him that I would punish the former. All my persuasion
was, however, in vain; he foamed with rage, and replied, that we
should both suffer for this act. Seeing that he was too weak to
offer battle to us both, he ran away in an instant, loudly uttering
his war-cry of “Lu, lu, lu!”<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This was an ill omen for
us, and put us both in no slight degree of fear. Flight was out of
the question, we had no chance of thus escaping. I, therefore, set
my wits to work to devise a remedy, to avert at least the first
outbreak of our enemies rage. I bound my servant hand and foot with
a cord, and taking up the branch of a tree which lay near me
pretended to beat him most unmercifully; he played his part
remarkably well, and screamed as if he were being impaled, whenever
I made the slightest movement with my hand; for we already descried
a crowd of natives at the distance, running towards us, their
lances glittering in the evening sun, and the shouts of the women,
who followed in the wake of the men, boded us no good; but the
nearer they approached the better we played our parts; and my
servant continued his screams until he was fairly out
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> breath. Those of
our enemies, who were nearest, called out to me to desist; and when
I obeyed, my servant rolled himself about in the sand like a
madman. The negro who had been the cause of the whole scene now
walked up to me, took my hand, and said, “Have no fear, you shall
not be hurt, because you have acknowledged the injury your servant
has done me, and have punished him for it.” An old man now untied
the cord which bound the hands and feet of the culprit, and
approached me, to be informed of the whole affair. They proved to
be Bakkara.<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class=
"fnanchor">[40]</a> I invited the old man and the negro, of whom I
have before spoken into my tent, where I entertained them with
coffee, and gave them my pipe to smoke. Harmony was immediately
restored, and every one conciliated. They asked me whence I came,
and where I was travelling to, and then the conversation turned on
other topics. When the night closed in, they all gradually retired,
with the exception of five men, who remained with me all night as a
guard, emptied several pots of merissa together, and kept up the
fire, thus consuming the whole of the wood which had been the
<i>belli teterrima causa</i>. When they took their leave of me in
the morning, they presented me with a young gazelle, as provision
for my further journey.</p>

<p>I cannot sufficiently praise the kind, and even
cordial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> behaviour
of the natives of Kordofan. I received many proofs of kindness at
their hands, and I could not have expected better treatment in my
own country from my nearest relations. This was especially the case
when I had the misfortune to fall sick in the desert, where I lay
helpless on the sands, as I was too weak to keep my seat on my
camel. In this state of exhaustion I was obliged to remain, until I
could receive assistance from the neighbouring village, which was,
fortunately, only half an hours march distant from the spot. A
good-natured inhabitant carried me home, and I passed thirty days
in his hut, stretched upon a bed of sickness. I cannot describe the
interest these kind people appeared to take in my sufferings; the
one vied with the other to be of service to me. Some women and
girls sat alternately by the side of my bed, by day and night, the
one keeping off the flies, the other cooling me with a fan of
ostrich feathers, for the heat was frequently at 40° Reaumur (122°
Fahrenheit) in my hut, as there was no current of air through it. A
young and beautiful slave, Agami was her name, evinced so much
sympathy, that she frequently shed tears when she observed my
sufferings. All the medicines with which I had taken the precaution
to provide myself, proved ineffective; I lay in a continued fever,
and was already, on the fifth day, so weak that I could not move,
and the good women were obliged to lift me on and off the bed; for
my own part, I had quite<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_105">[105]</span> made up my mind that my days were drawing
to a close.</p>

<p>When no amelioration was observed to take place, they bound
amulets round my arms, and placed charms beneath my head,
endeavouring in this way to overcome the disease. I submitted to
all these proceedings in order not to avoid hurting the feelings of
the good people; but as my illness still continued to rage, they
sent for a celebrated fortune-teller from a neighbouring village,
who casting her shells upon the sand, prophesied that the Frank
would not yet die. As soon as the prophetess had taken her
departure, the women lifted me out of bed, seated me down on a
bundle of straw, with my back to the door, took off my shirt, and
as I was too weak to sit in an upright position, held me up by
passing their arms under my axillae. I suddenly felt a shock
through my whole frame, which deprived me of breath for a few
moments, for they had poured a whole basket full of cold spring
water over my feverish body. Hundreds of others would have
instantly expired, but my sound constitution enabled me to survive
this douche. I was immediately dried, returned to bed, and covered
with empty sacks and sheep-skins. I felt somewhat relieved and fell
asleep; a refreshment I had not enjoyed for a long time. On waking,
the women told me that I had perspired but very slightly, and that
the douche must be repeated to put me into a thorough sweat. I
allowed this hazardous proceeding to be repeated<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> because I had no other choice.
The operation was performed in the same manner as on the former
occasion, but it did not produce so violent a shock, because I was
prepared for it. After this bath I perspired so freely that, on
waking, I believed myself to be in a second bath. This proceeding,
however, broke through the chain of morbid symptoms, and I felt so
much relieved, that I was able to rise from my bed, and walk about
for a short time in the shade of the palm-trees. As soon as the
rumour spread in the village that I was recovering, the inhabitants
all flocked around to greet me, and to congratulate me on my
convalescence. A fire was lighted before my hut at night, round
which the people danced to evince their delight at my recovery; I
regaled them with merissa, and all were happy and merry. My
convalescence proceeded now very rapidly, and I was in a short time
able to resume my journey; but I shall never forget the debt of
gratitude I owe to these good people, who, from pure and
disinterested charity and feeling for the sufferings of a fellow
creature, took so much care of me whilst in this lamentable
condition.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span><a id=
"c05"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="med">CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> exists, perhaps, no country in
which the inhabitants are so various, and diametrically opposed to
each other in character as in Kordofan; for, after half a day’s
journey from one district to the other, the traveller is almost
tempted to believe that he has arrived in a different country,
subject to quite a different government, and professing a different
religion. A shade of variation in the race of the people quite
alters their characters. There are, properly speaking, three
distinct races of men abruptly differing from each other in the
province: namely the negroes, properly so called, or Aborigines;
then the Arabs or free people, to which class the Bakkara belong;
and, lastly, those who have emigrated from Dongola. The negroes
who, with the exception of many slaves, profess the faith of Islam,
are to be met with distributed over all the five districts, and
occupy themselves chiefly with agriculture. Their wants are,
therefore, fewer than those of the trading population, who on their
travels have become acquainted with many comforts, which
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> become
additional necessaries imperative to them. These negroes, the
greater part of which are Noubas, are of very amiable disposition,
extremely hospitable, exceedingly fond of their children, and
possess the most honourable feelings. In their dealings they are
particularly upright, and there is no fear of being overreached in
transacting business with them; I will even go so far as to say
there is less to be feared in their dwellings than in many European
towns which appear far more safe. They are sincere friends, and
assist each other in all difficulties; are endowed with a strong
attachment to their native country; and only the most tyrannical
oppression, such as existed under the government of the Defturdar,
could force a few villages to leave their native land. When they
are, however, enraged, they utterly disregard life for the
opportunity of revenging themselves. Anger, however, is of
exceedingly rare occurrence with their good tempers; and when a
negro is observed to be carried away by passion, a few kind words
are only required to pacify him; but harshness must by no means be
resorted to. It is, in fact, necessary to treat them like children;
for their mental faculties are very limited, and they may, indeed,
be said to be on the lowest scale. There is, moreover, not the
slightest probability of their ever making any progress in the
cultivation of their minds, for they manage everything at the
present day as it was done a hundred years ago. Their dwellings and
domestic utensils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
in short everything is the same as it was in the time of their
forefathers. By the manner in which they perform their work, it is
easy to perceive that they follow the plan adopted in former
centuries, and the idea never enters their heads of improving upon
any object, or of making a new invention. This apathy to all
progressive improvement is the more astonishing, as these negroes
are for the greater part agriculturists, and have fixed places of
residence, and consequently enjoy the opportunity of gradually
perfecting themselves, as many other nations have done before them,
who formerly stood at the same low degree of civilization. Amongst
these people, however, civilization is in a state of permanent
stagnation. A few individuals may indeed be met with who can read
and write a little, but that is not worth mentioning, and thus
everything is enveloped in the densest obscurity. The climate
contributes in no small degree to this obtuseness of mind, and it
is a well-proved fact, that Europeans who have passed several years
in these parts suffer a diminution in their capacity of mind, and
in time forget a great part of their former acquirements. Apathy
and phlegma are congenital with the negroes: it is, therefore, not
probable that they will ever rise in the scale of civilization. The
west of Africa may, perhaps, form an exception to this rule.</p>

<p>These people are very candid and confiding, when they are
acquainted with a person; they then seldom or never make a secret
of their actions,—<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span>never, indeed, unless they believe their
personal or the public interest to be endangered by the
communication. The people of a similar race in the neighbouring
countries are of the same character: an observation, the slaves
brought from these parts afford ample opportunity of making. These
slaves are for the most part heathens, and this is the chief reason
why they, and the tribes allied to them, are rather harshly
treated. If, in the course of time, they adopt the faith of Islam,
they are at least treated more like one of the family, although not
liberated. The fate of these unfortunate beings is, on the whole,
dreadful; for deprived of the greatest blessing, their liberty,
they are forced to perform hard labour, and indeed in fetters, in
which they are bound to prevent them from running away to their
native hills, frequently in sight of their place of captivity.
These fetters, unlike the irons with which convicts are laden in
Europe, consist of rings round both ankles, kept asunder by an iron
bar, attached to the rings round the ankles by two smaller rings.
Thus the slave can make but one pace at a time, and never
approximate his two feet. The large rings open on one side
sufficiently to admit the ankle, and in adjusting them they are
welded together with a large stone, in lieu of a hammer. The slave,
on these occasions, is laid upon the ground, and a stone is pushed
under his foot to serve the purpose of an anvil. Every precaution
is, indeed, taken in putting on the irons,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_111">[111]</span> but the unfortunate being feels severe pain
with every blow. Some few fetters may be met with furnished with
locks, which, however, are very rare luxuries. To prevent the rings
from excoriating the ankles, rags are interposed between the iron
and the skin. If the operation of putting on the irons be attended
with pain, the slaves suffer infinitely more when they are taken
off. On the latter occasion one side of the ring is firmly attached
to a tree, the slave lays himself down on his back, and about eight
people pull in the direction opposite to the tree, at a cord
attached to the ring, until it is sufficiently opened to allow the
ankle to be disengaged. A quarter of an hour is sometimes spent in
efforts to remove the trammels.</p>

<p>The negroes are, generally, at the commencement of their
slavery, morose, and speak very little, unless spoken to. Their
thoughts are continually directed to their homes, or at work
inventing all manner of means of escape, for the prevention of
which they are bound in irons. They are all powerful men, and are
put to agricultural labour, very few of this race being sent to
Egypt. Many of them are aware that urine will, in time, corrode
iron, and this knowledge enables them, occasionally, to succeed in
gradually ridding themselves of their fetters, when they, of
course, immediately decamp. A negro who had liberated himself in
this manner told me he had resorted to this process himself. His
flight, however, unfortunately failed, for he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_112">[112]</span> was soon caught and brought back again.
Fourteen whole months were required to soften the iron, before he
could complete his work of breaking it through with a stone. There
are many slaves who do not wear irons, especially such as have
lived many years with one master, who has become thoroughly
acquainted with their character; but even these men are frequently,
after many years, attacked with nostalgia, and then take to flight.
During my residence in the country, a slave, who had lived seven
years in one house, where he had walked about unfettered, suddenly
ran away, without any appreciable cause. Another captive, who wore
irons, volunteered to bring the deserter back, if his master would
allow him, henceforth, to lay aside his fetters, assuring him, at
the same time, that he would remain his slave for life, and did not
wish for liberty. The master was, certainly, at first, rather
undecided, but ultimately ventured to allow him to sally forth on
this expedition, and furnished him, moreover, with a camel. He
returned, in a short time, bringing the fugitive back with him. The
master kept his word, took the fetters off, and bought him a female
slave as a wife, whereas the deserter was put in chains,—probably
for life. The girls walk about at liberty, because there is not so
much fear of their running away. They would soon be brought back,
are, moreover, very timid, and would be readily recognised in the
next village; but they sometimes also effect their<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> escape, as I had myself once
the opportunity of observing.</p>

<p>A slave merchant at Lobeid kept eight girls, destined for Grand
Cairo, together in one house, and locked them up carefully in a
room without windows; to be yet more secure, he placed his angareb
at night before the door and slept there. How great was his
astonishment, however, in the morning, to find that all the girls
had disappeared out of the room! He ran about, as if mad, to all
his neighbours, begging them to assist him in his search; but all
endeavours to find the fugitives were in vain, and the man firmly
believed the Shitan<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"
class="fnanchor">[41]</a> had spirited them away. In making a
closer investigation of the wall of the room, however, a light was
soon thrown upon the subject, for an immense hole was found through
which the girls had crept and covered it carefully with a straw
mat. It appeared that they had thrown water against the wall of
clay, a few days before they had effected their escape, and were
thus enabled to make the breach with facility, for these houses
melt like sugar when water is poured upon them. Not one of these
girls ever again made her appearance.</p>

<p>The natives of Kordofan treat their slaves with much humanity;
the Turks, on the other hand, (and I am sorry to say, within the
last few years, two Europeans also,) are guilty of the greatest
cruelty, and are not deterred by qualms of conscience
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> staining their
hands with the blood of these unfortunate beings. Thus, an Italian
doctor bound a rope round the neck of his slave and strangled him
with his own hands; another medical man, a renegade, castrated his
slave with his own razor, for some trifling offence he had been
guilty of. The man died of the effects of the operation. Mohammed
Bey also, the governor of Kordofan, whom Mehemed Ali deposed
towards the close of the year 1838, and not without good cause,
treated his slaves most barbarously, as the following fact will
illustrate. A female slave belonging to his haárem was guilty of
some slight offence, which, however, enraged him to such an extent
that he ordered her to be thrown into a distant well and drowned.
One of the servants, happening to pass the well on the following
day, found the girl still living, reported the circumstance to the
governor, and asked whether he should liberate her, as the water
only reached her arms; the tyrant, however, felt no pity for the
poor wretch, and ordered the well to be filled up with sand, thus
burying his victim alive.</p>

<p>The Arabs, or free people, to which the Bakkara and other
nomadic tribes belong, differ totally from the aborigines; they
breed camels and other cattle, and engage but little in
agricultural pursuits. The largest tribes of Bakkara are, el Giomme
Hababin under Sheikh Abdel Machmud, Elhawasma under Sheikh Moosa,
el Messeria under Sheikh Labaeid,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_115">[115]</span> el Nassarie, Hababin, el Hommer, etc.;
beside these, the Kubbabeesh under Sheikh Salé must be mentioned.
These Arabs, as they call themselves, are, like the negroes, black;
one tribe of Bakkara, (Hababin,) however, is copper-coloured,
although they live under the same zone and lead the same kind of
life. I very much doubt the tradition, that all these tribes
wandered out of Arabia into Africa, during the great migration of
nations in the seventh century. I know of no tribe in all Araby of
black colour, and the climate of Africa could not have made them as
dark as they are at present, even in a thousand years. If this
discoloration be the effect of climate, why have not the red
Bakkara, as they are here called, become black? for the
copper-coloured nations more readily change to black than those of
white complexion. Their features, moreover, bear no resemblance to
those of the Arabs; they are, also, unlike the negroes; they have
not the prominent cheek-bones and the thick everted lips; their
hair is rather smooth than curling, and they wear a number of
plaits. This race is, in part, of pure blood, and yet they speak
very bad Arabic, whereas other Arab tribes, who live at a much
greater distance from the parent country, as several tribes of
Bedouins, have preserved the native purity of their language. It is
far more probable, then, that these Arabs have been inhabitants of
Africa, on the borders of the Red Sea and in the neighbouring
deserts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> since
thousands of years, and that the red Bakkara, as they are termed,
formerly inhabited a country under the tropics, for in their
profiles, and in the manner in which they wear their hair, they
correspond exactly with those figures observed on monuments in
Upper Egypt and Nubia. In disposition they differ entirely from the
negroes, for they are stupid, proud, and very suspicious, despise
every one who is not of their caste, and endeavour, moreover, to
overreach every person with whom they may have dealings. The
traveller cannot be too well on his guard against them. In
concluding a bargain with them it is necessary that some one be
present who does not belong to their tribe, or the stranger may
make sure of being imposed upon. The chastity of their wives and
daughters is very praiseworthy.</p>

<p>The Dongolavi, a race of people distributed, under different
denominations, over a great part of Africa, are men of athletic
build, on whom little fat is seen, but the more muscle and sinew.
They have well formed features, but deeply set and very sparkling
eyes; their beards are weak, and they mostly only wear a moustache,
less frequently an additional tuft on the under lip. They do not
show age, except they are very old and the beard has become grey.
They vary in colour from bronze to jet black; this difference is
owing to the circumstance of their having mixed much with other
nations, and intermarried. Their language resembles that of the
Nuba in its etymology. The Dongolavi<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_117">[117]</span> are the most opulent inhabitants of
Kordofan, and nearly the whole of the export trade by caravan is in
their hands. They, also, carry on the less important home trade
with the negroes in the hills, with whom they barter for slaves,
ivory, etc. They have immigrated from Dongola into Kordofan, and
are to be met with in other negro states, where they have become
residents chiefly for the sake of the trade. The Dongolavi have
frequently, also, been obliged to fly and settle in different
places, on account of debt or other offences; they are of very
cheerful disposition, but shun all manner of work. They are the
greatest liars on the face of the earth, for truth never proceeds
from their mouths; they will, indeed, rather allow themselves to be
murdered than speak the truth, especially if their interests be
concerned. In trading with them, they should never be trusted with
cash, which would be irrecoverably lost, for they will part with
their wives and children rather than with money. They know no
gratitude, and understand merely how to flatter. If a person accept
anything of them, he may rest assured that they will demand, at
least, twice as much as it is worth, on the following day. Their
women are very frivolous. Servants of this tribe should be
carefully avoided; and I advise, indeed, every European about to
travel in Kordofan to hire his servant at Cairo.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span><a id=
"c06"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="med">THE BAKKARA. (NOMADIC TRIBES.)</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> are several large and small tribes
of this nomadic people in the country who have no fixed places of
residence, but change them frequently in the same year. They
inhabit the districts situated towards the south, south-east, and
south-west of Lobeid. Each tribe, whether large or small, is
governed by its sheikh, who may be regarded almost as an absolute
monarch; as all the rest of the tribe, with the exception of a few
under-sheikhs, are totally dependent upon him, and may, indeed, be
considered as his serfs. They pay tribute to Kordofan, consisting
of about twelve thousand oxen, a little gold, and a few slaves; but
the contribution must generally be collected by force. They are not
reckoned among the other inhabitants of the five districts; but
when the time for levying the tribute arrives, they are hunted out,
tribe by tribe, and—plundered. They do not cultivate agriculture,
excepting on the lake of Arrat, where a little rice, of an inferior
quality, is grown. Their occupation consists otherwise in breeding
horned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> cattle, and,
besides herds of kine, they possess a few horses and camels. The
sheikhs are all wealthy, and carry on a considerable trade in
cattle, butter, and slaves, the latter of which they steal from the
bordering countries. They are a very warlike and depredatory race,
and live in a continual state of warfare, not only with their
neighbours, but even among themselves; for if two Bakkara tribes
meet, or are merely encamped near each other, there is sure to be
bloodshed; nor does the conflict terminate until the weaker tribe
succumbs, or is driven away. With the commencement of the hot
season, they wander into distant regions, unknown to the governor
of Kordofan, into which he dare not venture to penetrate to levy
the taxes, as this measure would be attended with great danger to
his troops. It is, indeed, impossible for the government to send a
large force, as it would meet with many obstacles, and a small
detachment would not answer the purpose, for it might be easily
intercepted, and totally cut up. Thus this people enjoy exemption
from all contributions during the dry season. The government,
however, suffers no loss thereby, for it knows full well that they
will, in a short time, be forced to leave the safe districts beyond
the boundaries of Kordofan, and thus return spontaneously into the
hands of their oppressors. There is, perhaps, no people who have so
many and such dangerous enemies. All the negro tribes, without
exception, persecute the Bakkara from one<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_120">[120]</span> region to the other, on account of the
slaves they have kidnapped, and endeavour, by all possible means,
to revenge themselves on them. The government does all in its power
to torment this people in the most piteous manner; and, lastly, add
the quarrels of the tribes among themselves. Annoyances of this
description would be sufficient in themselves to force the Bakkari
to change their residences continually.</p>

<p>But their greatest plague is a little animal, called
<em>Yohara</em><a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42"
class="fnanchor">[42]</a>—a fly which makes its appearance in great
numbers, in many regions in central Africa, in the rainy season,
and proves very destructive. Its bite is harmless to man, but the
more dangerous to cattle, and instances are on record, in several
regions, of whole herds having been destroyed by these vermin in a
very short time. The camels, who cannot defend themselves with
their short tails against their encroachments, and must, therefore,
of course perish, suffer chiefly. In Shilluk, Shabun, Runga, Kulla,
etc., no camels are, consequently, to be met with; these countries,
therefore, can only be visited in the dry season. The Djelabi are
frequently prevented from entering on their march home from these
countries betimes, and have, on these occasions, lost all their
camels by the sting of this fly. This insect is also the chief
cause of the Bakkari leaving these parts of the country, which are
otherwise so safe for them, and so advantageous for their
cattle;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> it forces
them, in fact, to deliver themselves into the hands of the Turks.
Their habits are very simple, and they occupy themselves with
attending to the cattle, and occasionally with warlike
exercises.</p>

<p>I passed some time among one of the Bakkara tribes, on the lake
of Arrat, and had ample time and opportunity for making myself
thoroughly acquainted with the people, and their habits and
customs, for they kept nothing secret from me, and, as they knew
for certain that I was no Turk, they received me with extraordinary
hospitality. I would, however, not advise an European to entrust
himself to their care, or to venture too near to their encampment,
without having previously secured the friendship of their sheikhs;
for his life would be exposed to all manner of dangers, as they do
not even know the word European, or Frank, as we are otherwise
termed, but look upon every person of white colour as a Turk,
consequently as their enemy. But their acquaintance being once
made, the traveller may be certain of receiving the most
unequivocal proofs of hospitality, and may place the greatest
confidence in them. Their food consists of meat alone, and milk; of
the latter there is such an abundance among them, that they give it
to their horses as drink, and it seems to agree excellently with
them. All the horses I saw, whilst sojourning among them, were of
very superior breed. The Bakkari eat very little bread, which is
reckoned a luxury, and merely enjoyed by their sheikhs.
Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> dwellings
consist of tents covered with ox hides. They pitch them in separate
divisions, and then enclose the whole camp, together with the space
of ground into which they drive the cattle, with a fence of thorns.
In the centre of the encampment, and generally on a slight
elevation, the chief guard-house is situated, which is inhabited by
a certain number of armed men, who are daily relieved. The guard is
armed with from three to six light javelins, and shields, and the
men are provided with their dar’book’keh (drum), in order to be
able to alarm the whole camp with the slightest danger. A fire is
also kept up all night at this guard-house. They generally dance
half the night long to keep themselves awake, are always prepared
for an attack, and cannot easily be surprised. The women and girls
pass the time of the watch with their husbands, or brothers, at the
chief guard-house, and join in the dances. Their dance differs
entirely from that of the other natives of Kordofan; it is very
fantastic, and has really something imposing about it. A large fire
is frequently lighted at each of the four corners of the space,
where the drummers, singers, and those who beat time, are located.
The dancers range themselves in two rows in the centre, the one
being formed of women, the opposite of men, armed with their
spears, with which they frequently strike the ground, in time,
during the dance. At first their movements are slow, but they are
soon hurried away by excitement; and the men swing
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> lances with a
fearful cry, as if they were about to throw them at the women, who
represent the enemy. The latter now assume a more humble
deportment, and evince their submission to the attacking party.
This dance must be seen, in order to form a proper conception of
it; and I can assure my readers, that nothing can be more
picturesque than to see this group of dancers on a dark night, the
scene lighted up by four blazing fires, when the stillness of the
night is only interrupted by the simple scream of a night-bird, the
distant roar of a lion, or the howl of a hyæna. The expressive
countenances of the dancers form an admirable picture, which well
accords with the wildness of the whole scene.</p>

<p>The women and girls are very talkative and friendly with those
they know; they all shook hands with me, and made repeated
enquiries about my health, and frequently asked me what I wished to
eat or drink. Nor are they by any means shy; for I even had the
opportunity of being present at the toilette of a sheikh’s wife.
The lady sat on an angareb (bedstead), surrounded by a number of
young and beautiful negro girls, upon each of which a particular
duty was incumbent. The one fanned away the flies with a handful of
the most beautiful ostrich feathers, whilst the others arranged her
hair, an occupation requiring several hours for its performance;
for it is no easy task to open all the various matted curls with a
single pointed wooden<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_124">[124]</span> peg. A third slave washed her feet, a
fourth ground sulphur to a fine powder between two stones. Another
slave held a gourd, filled with merissa, in her hand, to offer her
mistress a cooling draught whenever she might demand it; while
another girl held a cup, containing more than one pound of melted
butter, which was poured over the lady’s head as soon as the hair
was undone. All the butter that dropped off her hair on to her back
was rubbed in over her whole body by an additional attendant. In
conclusion, her head was powdered with the fine flower of sulphur,
which was strewn by handfulls over her greasy hair, where every
single grain remained adherent. A massive golden ring was now
inserted in her nostrils, and two bracelets of ivory, about two
inches in breadth, were put upon her arms. On her forehead three
pieces of amber, about the size of a gold coin, were hung, and
round her neck, several strings of beads, formed of Bohemian glass.
A piece of cotton stuff was wound round her loins, the one end of
which was thrown gracefully over her right shoulder, and thus the
toilette of this black princess was completed. She now admired
herself once more in the mirror, represented by half a gourd filled
with water. It must not be imagined that these women in any way
offend against the dictates of delicacy; for although, like the
other inhabitants of this hot climate, they are totally naked, with
the exception of a piece of cotton, or a leathern apron (rahat),
round their loins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
they never transgress the rules of the most rigid propriety. The
women are, without exception, handsome, and are treated very well
by their husbands. Their occupation consists in cooking, and
attending to other domestic duties; but when the men go into
battle, they by no means remain idle spectators, but encourage them
with their shouts, and assist them in every way in offering the
most resolute resistance.</p>

<p>The men attend to the cattle, and make depredatory excursions
for stealing slaves, on which occasions their few, but exceedingly
beautiful and hardy horses render them essential service. When a
tribe of Bakkara is encamped in the vicinity of the hills of the
negroes, the horsemen are sent out to kidnap boys or girls. They
have not yet had the courage to carry on this business on the same
extensive scale as Mehemed Ali. The mode of proceeding is the
following:—The Bakkari repair to places in which it is likely that
these children will congregate,—for example, in the vicinity of
separate droves of cattle, or to wells,—where they lie in ambush,
and as soon as one of the children is within reach, they seize it,
mount their horses, and ride away with their prize at full gallop.
Although the scene of this robbery may be in the neighbourhood of a
village, or of a tribe of negroes, and it even create a
disturbance, yet they are certain of their prey, for their fleet
steeds soon carry them beyond the reach of their pursuers, who,
moreover, possess no horses.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_126">[126]</span> They live very contentedly among
themselves, and are very happy, as I was assured by one of their
sheikhs, who added,—“We have beautiful horses, handsome wives, good
fare, suffer no want, and might even call ourselves rich; but our
enemies, who surround us on all sides, and especially the flies, so
dangerous to our cattle, embitter our lives; for, in order to
escape the latter plague, we are forced to leave the safe parts of
the country. In the neighbourhood of the negroes we cannot remain,
as they would rise in mass against us, and destroy us all, in
revenge for their kidnapped children; thus we are forced to choose
the least of these many evils, and to deliver ourselves into the
hands of the Turks, who treat us with great harshness and cruelty,
and take away by force what we will not give them willingly,—but
<span class="sc">Allah Kerim</span> (as God will)!”</p>

<p>The government of Kordofan treats this people, indeed, with
every species of cruelty; for as soon as they are necessitated to
fly from the more distant regions, and make their appearance in the
neighbourhood of Kordofan, troops are immediately despatched to
demand the tribute of them. I was myself an eye-witness of this
scene, and saw nothing but unmerciful extortion and barbarous
brutality used, which is, unfortunately, the ordinary proceeding of
that government. A major, with three subaltern officers, and two
hundred men, rank and file, of infantry, attended by a few Bedouin
horsemen, and fifty men<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_127">[127]</span> of irregular troops, received orders to
proceed from Lobeid to levy the annual tribute, consisting of one
thousand heads of oxen, from the nearest Bakkara. The tribe,
acquainted with the approach of their enemies, did all in their
power to entertain them to the best of their means. On their
arrival, several oxen and sheep were daily slaughtered, merissa was
served in abundance, all kinds of amusements were introduced, in
short, nothing was neglected that might render the sojourn
agreeable to their tormentors. The officers and soldiers felt
exceedingly comfortable with this kind of life during four days,
enjoyed their Keyf,<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and everything went off very peaceably
and all were happy. On the fifth day, however, the scene suddenly
changed: for the major had a sheikh summoned into his presence, and
greeting him with all the customary terms of abuse, said, in a
harsh tone,—“Do you remember that you gave me last year the worst
and leanest cattle, the greater part of which died on the road, and
that I had to make good the loss to Mehemed Ali from my own purse!
That I may not suffer a similar loss this year, I draw your
attention to this circumstance, and shall immediately take care to
impress it also on your memory.” He hereupon ordered
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> sheikh to lay
himself on the ground. Entreaties, prayers, and promises, were all
in vain. Two corporals seized the condemned man, threw him forcibly
to the ground, and stood in readiness to inflict the punishment the
major might think fit to order, with the whips of hippopotamus’
hide they held in their hands. The delinquent again endeavoured to
conciliate the major with entreaties, and, begging for mercy,
assured him that he would not only give him very good cattle this
time, but, moreover, make him a present, as a compensation for the
loss he had sustained the preceding year. This was what the
extortioner wanted; but to intimidate the sheikh the more, and to
force him to increase his liberality, he pretended to be
inflexible; at last, however, he allowed the supplicant to rise,
and go home to fetch the promised presents. The sheikh hastened
immediately to fulfil his promise, and brought the major four large
nose-rings of massive gold, and two slaves for each officer. Thus
harmony was once more restored; the number of oxen required, and,
indeed, from the best herd, were selected, and the march was
ordered back to Lobeid.</p>

<p>On every occasion of levying tribute, the commanding officer,
after having collected the government dues, allows himself all
kinds of cruelties and oppressive means to extort a present for
himself and his men. A sheikh of the Bakkara told me,—and the
soldiers subsequently corroborated his statement,—that two years
ago a major, who had already<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> collected the tribute from a small Bakkara
tribe, and had besides received considerable presents for himself
and his officers, not contented with the booty, resorted to a
singularly cruel plan for forcing them to greater liberality.</p>

<p>A sergeant, who was in the secret, feigning drunkenness, went
into a tent in which the sheikh’s wives were kept, and there
conducted himself with so much impropriety, that the women ordered
him to leave the place. He refused to obey; and seized upon a
woman, who, not knowing how to free herself from his importunities,
began to scream. On hearing the cry, several Bakkara, who happened
to be near, entered the tent, and one of them, witnessing the
sergeant’s indecorous behaviour, dealt him a blow. This was what
the soldier expected; he immediately made a great noise, ushered
himself instantly into the presence of the commanding officer, and
complained that a Bakkara had dared to strike one of Mehemed Ali’s
soldiers. For this offence, the commanding officer demanded a most
enormous fine, and ordered his troops to take possession of all the
sheikh’s women and girls, and to keep them as hostages. The sheikh
himself was now summoned, and told to bring instantly an addition
of two hundred oxen, as a compensation for the offence offered to a
soldier in the service of the government. To give additional weight
to these orders, and to intimidate the chief the more, the
barbarian had one of the sheikh’s wives and two of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> his female slaves hewn to
pieces by a corporal, in his presence, informing him, at the same
time, that a similar fate awaited all his wives and female slaves,
if the two hundred oxen demanded were not instantly forthcoming.
The sheikh, terrified to the utmost by these proceedings, promised
to satisfy their demands, and in a few hours the number of oxen
required were delivered to the extortioner. The cattle was of
course shared by those who were privy to the secret.</p>

<p>As the delivery of cattle to Egypt is at present put an end to
by order of the Viceroy, the Bakkara have no longer to suffer these
torments; but they are, no doubt, tortured in some other way. The
southern provinces, as Dongola, Sennaar, and Kordofan, have, for
several years past, been forced to tender twelve thousand oxen
annually for Egypt alone; eight or nine thousand heads being the
stipulated portion required from Kordofan. More than one half of
these animals perished on the road on account of the bad management
with which the transport was conducted, and thus the government
suffered a great loss. Sheds where grass or chaff was kept for the
transport were, indeed, erected between Deppa and Cairo, at a
distance of each day’s march; but these shunes, as they are here
termed, were under very bad direction; for the inspectors sold the
greater part of the forage, and thus the cattle were but sparingly
fed, and the exhausted beasts were deprived of the opportunity
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> recruiting their
strength. A second error was also prevalent, namely, that of not
allowing tired or sick beasts to rest on the road, for they were
driven on with the rest of the drove until they dropped. Thus by
bad management one half the cattle was annually lost, although they
might easily have been preserved by more careful treatment, and
would have been of invaluable assistance to the northern part of
Egypt, where the consumption of beasts is considerable.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span><a id=
"c07"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="med">THE KUBBABEESH.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">This</span> small nomadic tribe inhabits the
country to the east of the Bahr Abiad (White Nile), and allied
tribes are to be met with in the province of Dongola. They differ
somewhat in their habits from the Bakkara, remain stationary
throughout the year in Kordofan, merely changing their pastures
frequently. They scarcely follow any agricultural pursuits, and
breed but very little cattle. Their actual occupation consists
merely in effecting the transports which the government sends to
Dongola and Sennaar, and in supplying the caravans of the Djelabi
proceeding in all directions over Africa with the camels necessary
for their purpose. They themselves breed very few of these animals,
but buy the greater quantity in the country. Their accurate
acquaintance with the roads in every direction across the desert is
truly wonderful. They readily shape their course by the heavens by
day or night, know exactly where they are, and can tell to a nicety
the exact distance from the position in which they may happen to be
to any other place. Their senses both<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_133">[133]</span> of sight and hearing are so acute and
quick, that they can distinguish, at the greatest distance, objects
which an European could only see with the aid of a telescope; they
can even at night-time perceive camels at long distances, seldom
deceiving themselves in the estimation of their numbers; they are,
therefore, invaluable to the government in the transport of the
various products of the country, and to the caravans passing
through the country, in general, they are almost indispensable.
Their sheikhs, who, I may say, are lords and masters, consider
their subjects as their serfs, and treat them accordingly. This
race of men is already much contaminated by mixing with negro
women. The sheikhs make a considerable profit by furnishing
travellers with camels; the more so as their expenses on the road
may be considered a mere trifle, for they find the food for their
camels on the road-side, and the drivers receive only a little
flour for bread, (which, however, they do not bake daily,) or
dockn, a small quantity of which they boil in water and call
belilleh. With a small bag of these hard pills they undertake the
longest journeys, and will bear hunger and thirst for an
astonishing length of time. Locusts they consider a delicacy. The
head, wings, and first joints of the hind-legs of the insect are
torn off, and the body, spitted on a wooden skewer, is roasted over
the coals. At first I could not make up my mind to taste these
insects, but two woful days, many of which may be passed in Africa,
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> last compelled
me to eat them. The hard pills, or belilleh, were too dry for me,
and would not pass down my throat; I therefore made the best of a
bad case, and resorted to locusts. At first, as I before mentioned,
I felt a slight degree of disgust, and I could not relish them, but
I subsequently consoled myself with John the Baptist and Allah
Kerim. When the Kubbabeesh meet with a sick camel, which the
caravans are frequently obliged to leave behind them, they
immediately cut its throat, and make a hearty meal; the rest of the
meat is laden on their own camels, and eaten even when covered with
maggots. They use no doga in making their bread, but bake it after
the fashion of many of the negro tribes; that is to say, they lay
several stones close together in form of a circle, selecting
pebbles, if they can find them, as the small stones become more
quickly heated, and light a large fire upon them. As soon as the
wood is consumed, they remove the charcoal from the stones, and
spread a paste of dockn flour, of the thickness of three fingers,
on them, covering it carefully over with the coal. The bread is
baked in a very short time, or, to speak more accurately, the upper
and lower crust is burnt whilst the paste remains unbaked in the
interior. They are not paid any wages, but, at the feast of the
great Baëram, a present is made them of a piece of cotton and a
dollar.</p>

<p>On journeys it is as well to behave with kindness towards these
children of the desert, for although life<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_135">[135]</span> may never be endangered by them, they
injure those who treat them with harshness in a manner which is
most severely felt. Their mode of revenging themselves generally
consists in making an almost imperceptible incision with their
lances into the leather bags containing the water, which is thus
wasted, and does not last over the expected time. They call
themselves sultans of the desert, and the stranger is indeed
entirely at their mercy, for they can themselves bear thirst well
for one day or longer, but travellers are dreadfully tortured by
this proceeding; hence it is much better not to injure these poor
people in any way, as they are by no means officious, but readily
perform all the services required of them for a mere trifle.</p>

<p>Merchandize and goods entrusted to them are well taken care of,
for their sheikh, with whom an agreement touching the delivery of
the goods is made, is answerable for their safe arrival. Anything
that may be stolen by his people, or destroyed through their
neglect, he is forced to make good; he consequently only receives
one half of the stipulated payment in advance. On my journey to
Kordofan I met with seventeen camel-loads of gum and hides, near
the ravine of Semmeria, which the Kubbabeesh, for some reason with
which I am not acquainted, left lying in the road, having
themselves decamped with their camels. Neither the gum nor the
hides had suffered any damage, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_136">[136]</span> the whole cargo was subsequently safely
delivered at Dongola. The Divan of Lobeid, however, made a demand
of thirty thousand piasters as an indemnification for the loss said
to be sustained by the damage done to the goods. The sheikh was
forced to pay this sum to the very farthing, although the goods had
not cost the government more than about one thousand piasters; for
the government pays one ox-hide with three piasters, and a cantaro
of gum with fifteen piasters. The government, moreover, had not
even lost anything in interest for the capital laid out, as the
occurrence took place during the dry season. But this is the system
pursued by this tyrannical administration for extorting money from
this tribe, which is otherwise not highly taxed, and thus it again
deprives them of their hard-earned wages, a pittance literally
gained by the sweat of their brow, as their pay is always most
narrowly calculated; and so much is, moreover, deducted from the
sum agreed upon, that barely enough remains to keep them from
starving.</p>

<p>It has been proved, by accurate calculation, that the Kubbabeesh
must make considerable sums by the thousands of camel-loads which
the government and the many Djelabi, transport, especially as their
own expenses are but trifling. In order, therefore, to lessen these
profits, as far as this is possible, for the benefit of their
employers, all manner of ruses and subterfuges are resorted to, to
enable the government to sue the sheikhs for a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_137">[137]</span> compensation for damage sustained. The
gum is forwarded immediately after it has been collected from the
trees, when four cantari constitute a camel-load. The distance from
Kordofan to Dongola, is twenty days’ journey. Wind and heat will
dry gum, and it of course decreases in bulk and weight; much is,
moreover, lost on the road, in consequence of the slovenly manner
in which it is packed. Arrived at Dongola, it is left several days
lying in the sun before it is weighed, the natural consequence of
this exposure is, that each load suffers a considerable reduction
in weight. All this loss the sheikh has to make good, and in
effecting the arrangement, the gum is calculated at the price at
which the government sells it in Alexandria to the Europeans; thus
the sheikh frequently only receives a quarter of the sum agreed
upon for the freight, and not even this pittance in ready money,
for he is finally compelled to accept cotton-stuff, manufactured at
Dongola, in lieu of payment, taking the piece sold by the
government in the same place for twelve piasters, at a value of
twenty piasters. Goaded to the utmost by oppressions of this
description, the subjects of a small sheikh determined, in the year
1838, to leave Kordofan, and settle in Darfour. The poor people,
however, gained nothing by this movement, but fell, as the proverb
has it, out of the frying-pan into the fire; for on their arrival
at Darfour, where they intended to place themselves under the
protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> of the
Sultan Mohammed Fadel, he seized nearly all their camels, with the
exception only of some few beasts, laden with bread and water, and
had the emigrants hunted over the borders, thus they were forced to
deliver themselves again into the hands of their former tormentors
in Kordofan. When Mehemed Ali, on his last journey, heard this, he
summoned, on his arrival at Khartoom, Salé, the great sheikh of the
Kubbabeesh, into his presence, and flattered him in every possible
manner, in order to win him over; he even did him the extraordinary
honour of allowing him to sit on his right hand, and after having
convinced himself of the injustice under which his people groaned,
promised to take the measures necessary for their relief. The
Viceroy immediately raised the rate of freightage of a camel-load
from forty-five to eighty piasters, and thus Sheikh Salé was
conciliated. On the same occasion, Mehemed Ali asked the chief the
reason why he, so young a man, had already a grey beard? This
question he impressively answered by saying,—“Your Turks are the
cause of my beard turning grey; for they oppress and torment me in
every possible way, and make me grow old before my time!” Mehemed
Ali consoled him, and took leave of him with that flattering
language so peculiar to him on these occasions. The government, in
fact, well understands the necessity of keeping on good terms with
these good people; for the services they perform are invaluable,
and nothing is, moreover,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_139">[139]</span> to be effected by force with this tribe;
for if they had the slightest idea that coercive measures were to
be employed against them, they would soon disappear out of
Kordofan. To emigrate into Darfour would certainly be too hazardous
an experiment; to the south and south-east the murderous fly, so
destructive to the camels, is to be met with, and helps materially
to compel them to remain in the country. Notwithstanding these
impediments, however, they know very well how to secure themselves
when force is employed against them, for the following facts were
related to me by an officer, who was himself an eye-witness of the
affair. The government was about to expedite several hundred
camel-loads of goods, and sent couriers to the Kubbabeesh with
orders to furnish the necessary quantity of camels, and bring them
to Lobeid; the latter, however, refused to obey. A considerable
military detachment was now sent to force them to submission, but
the government was very much deceived in its expectations of the
result; for the Kubbabeesh, acquainted with their intentions,
collected all their camels, and fled to the desert, where it was
impossible to overtake them. They always kept half a day’s march in
advance of the troops, could even frequently be descried at a
distance, but all attempts to overtake them were in vain; for,
thoroughly acquainted with all the roads and various localities,
they were enabled easily to deceive their pursuers, and thus to
effect their escape.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_140">[140]</span> Arrived on the third day at a spring, they
watered their camels, supplied themselves with the quantity of
water they required, filled up the well, and continued their march.
The soldiers, in their turn, arriving with their camels at the
well, found it destroyed, and were forced, for want of water, to
return, and give up the chase of the victorious Kubbabeesh. Thus
the government was obliged to wait patiently until they returned of
their own accord.</p>

<p>Their dress consists of a piece of cotton-stuff which they wind
round their bodies, and very few of them only wear shirts. Their
heads are uncovered, but on journeys they wear a sheep or goatskin,
after the fashion of the leathern apron of the miners of Germany,
to enable them to sit down, a position which would otherwise be
impracticable, considering the burning heat of the sand. They
always carry a few spears and a shield. Foreigners visiting these
countries cannot travel more economically than by engaging the
Kubbabeesh; in Dongola, the Dongolas indeed keep camels, but I
advise every one to give the preference to the former, for although
the government pays eighty piasters from Lobeid to Debba, or Dolip,
on the Nile, (in the province of Dongola,) whereas the Djelabi only
pay sixty piasters, sometimes even only forty-five, for the same
distance, and thirty piasters from Lobeid to Khartoom, the
Kubbabeesh always give the preference<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_141">[141]</span> to an engagement with the latter because
the payment, although less, is effected in ready money, whereas the
government make great deductions, and force them moreover to accept
of goods in lieu of cash.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span><a id=
"c08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="med">DAR-HAMMER.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">This</span> people immigrated several years ago
from Darfour into Kordofan; a large branch of the same tribe,
however, is yet to be found in the former country. Their occupation
consists in rearing camels and in agriculture. They are possessed
of the finest “ships of the desert” in Kordofan; they do not,
however, undertake transports like the Kubbabeesh, but merely trade
in these animals, which they sell to the Djelabi, Kubbabeesh, and
neighbouring tribes. They are obliged to furnish the government
with the quantity of camels necessary for the slave-hunts or other
grand expeditions, and to bring them to Cairo. They also form the
guard of the borders towards Darfour, several thousands of men
armed with shield and spear, and in part with large double-edged
swords being always in readiness to prevent an invasion from that
quarter. No incursion has ever yet taken place, but many a
depredatory excursion has been undertaken by the Dar-Hammer
themselves into the neighbouring villages of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_143">[143]</span> Darfour; and the Egyptian government not
only tolerates these marauding invasions, but lends the Dar-Hammer
every possible assistance, furnishing them even with a few Bedouin
horsemen on these occasions. These expeditions are, in fact,
virtually undertaken for the government, for the number of camels
they demand as tribute from the tribe is too great for the sheikh
to be able to furnish, and he is therefore forced to steal the
deficiency in Darfour.</p>

<p>When the sheikh, a few years ago, complained at the divan in
Lobeid, that it was not in his power to return the number of
animals required of him, and that he must make an incursion into
Darfour for the purpose of stealing camels to be able to satisfy
their claims; they not only approved of the measure, but agreed to
assist the sheikh in the execution of this useful project by
lending him a number of Bedouin horsemen. Thus, if there be a lack
of camels, an incursion is made without further question into the
nearest villages, to steal them. It is only astonishing that
Darfour puts up with this depredation without making any
reprisals.</p>

<p>The residence of the sheikh of the Dar-Hammer is situated at a
distance of twelve hours’ march from Lobeid. I made his
acquaintance in the town, and subsequently paid him a visit at his
quarters. He received me most hospitably, and I had the opportunity
of being present at a divan which he held in his spacious tukkoli.
The sheikh’s seat was on an angareb opposite the door, and by his
side sat one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> of his
four wives; he changes them, indeed, daily, and the great lady must
honour the divan with her presence. By his side lay his sword of
justice, with a massive silver hilt and silver head of the size of
a hen’s egg. The plaintiffs and defendants had arranged themselves
in the form of a half circle on the floor. A large earthen pot
filled with merissa was placed at the feet of the chief’s wife,
from which she offered both parties frequently a cup during the
transaction of the business. But this was done with a certain
degree of ceremony, in order to prove that the sheikh, as
arbitrator, knew no partiality, and that both parties were, in
fact, equal in his eyes. The decision of the arbitrator is always
short and decisive; is regarded as peremptory, and strictly acted
upon, for these good people go upon the principle that their head
can never be deceived.</p>

<p>The Dar-hammer do not differ in their domestic habits from the
other inhabitants of Kordofan, and are on the whole one of the most
amiable class of people in this province. They make a noise with
their tongues to express “yes or no,” like the other natives of
Kordofan; and this sound must have been frequently heard before it
is possible to distinguish between the negative and affirmative
tone.</p>

<p>During my whole residence in Kordofan I never heard of their
having ill-treated or robbed any stranger, much less of their
having committed murder; always excepting their excursions into
Darfour, which they do not regard as wrong, as they<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> are undertaken with the
sanction or, more properly speaking, at the command of the
government.</p>

<p>The chief sheikh, a very handsome man, is only to be
distinguished from the rest of his tribe by his silver hilted
sword. He is generally beloved by his subjects, and all his orders
are executed with a punctuality on which but few governments can
pride themselves. When out of doors he is always mounted, and his
horse might have been the boast of the stud of an European court;
for during all my travels I never saw a more beautiful animal, or
one of such pure breed.</p>

<p>The Dar-Hammer are very hospitable, and it requires but little
trouble to win the affection of these simple children of nature,
for they know but few wants, and are always satisfied with a
trifle. The women are not handsome, but of very amiable
disposition; they attend to the household affairs, and to the
children, and occupy their leisure hours, of which there are
certainly many, with their simple adornment. Their dress resembles
that of the other tribes; not even their sheikh wears a covering to
his head, nor do they indeed require it, for their bushy hair is so
thick that the rays of the sun could not easily penetrate through
it.</p>

<p>It is an axiom that where there is no water neither man nor
animals can live. A great tract of the Dar-Hammer forms, however,
an exception to this rule. This appears indeed incredible, but it
is, nevertheless, true; for when the rain-water which<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> collects in the small ponds,
called by the Dar-Hammer Fula, has evaporated, not a drop of
drinkable water is, commonly speaking, to be found in the various
districts they inhabit during three months of the year; and there
are no wells or cisterns in the country, with the exception of the
Nedjer wells. The villages, therefore, situated at a distance from
these springs, are obliged to send their women, children, old and
infirm men, their goats, sheep, and part of their camels, to the
above-mentioned wells, and to Ketshmar, during three months of the
year. Only the men, and a few camels, remain behind. To furnish a
substitute for water they resort to the following plan: they
cultivate large fields of water-melons, which ripen about the time
at which the scarcity of water begins to be felt. The ripe fruit is
daily gathered, and the juice expressed is not drunk, but used for
merissa, or boiling the assida and woika: they escape one
inconvenience which would result from a lack of water elsewhere,
for they have no linen to wash, and those who wear so luxurious an
article of dress as a shirt never wash it, even when there is
abundance of water. The camels remaining with them receive two
fresh melon husks daily. This allowance supplies them with the
quantity of fluid necessary for them, and they do not suffer in the
slightest degree from thirst; for, as a rule, camels are only
watered every two or three days.</p>

"c09"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="med">TRIBES BORDERING ON KORDOFAN, SHILLUK, NUBA,
TAKALE, ETC.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">On</span> the borders of the province of
Kordofan properly so called, towards the south-east, live the
Shilluk, and the Denky, or Jenky, as they are also termed; the
latter inhabit the eastern shore of the White Nile. The country of
the Shilluk occupies a very large tract of land extending
considerably into the interior towards the west of the White River.
Both tribes, the Shilluk as well as the Denky, seem to be one and
the same people, as far as their outward appearance, their build,
habits and customs are concerned, but their language differs. The
sultans of the Shilluk were formerly very potent: even Sennaar, the
realms of which extended to the borders of Dongola, they had
conquered; and the latter country was governed by one of the
sultan’s family as late as the year 1821, when it was rendered
tributary to Mehemed Ali by the superior force of the Egyptian
troops. The son of the last king of Sennaar is at present living in
a miserable village. Mehemed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> Ali, with peculiar consideration, has made
him magistrate of this village, where he lives in very straitened
circumstances. The Shilluks and Denky are easily distinguished from
among a concourse of other nations, for they have oblong heads, and
are more especially known by the want of the four lower incisor
teeth, which are extracted when they are ten or twelve years of
age, a kind of religious ceremony, as I was told, similar to that
of circumcision or baptism. They are of muscular build, and very
merry, but are not much prized as slaves, and are indeed always at
a lower price than other captives in Kordofan and Sennaar. The
chief reason of this discrepancy is that they are stupid, lazy, and
childish, and cannot be confidently entrusted with any duty. They
are to be seen running about all day long, or engaged in games
which could only please children. They are very treacherous, and
can never be left to themselves, but must, in fact, always be
placed under the inspection of other slaves. Those only who leave
home at a very early age form the exception to this rule. With such
deficiences they are, consequently, only used for the very lowest
class of labour, and treated not much better than beasts of burden.
Mehemed Ali, who formed his first regiment of foot entirely of
negroes, has latterly given orders not to enlist any more recruits
from this tribe; he found, indeed, that their services were not
only of no avail, but that their excessive stupidity was likely to
lead to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> ulterior
consequences; for there have been instances known of soldiers from
this tribe whilst on duty, giving their musket without hesitation,
and the charge into the bargain, to any casual passer-by who
happened to offer them a small present for it. In fact, the
officers were always obliged to keep these men under strict
inspection, for they were never to be trusted alone.</p>

<p>In many books of travels and geography the Shilluks are
described as cannibals, but this report is erroneous, and all
intelligence which I have been able to collect from the Djelabi on
this point agrees in proving this assertion to be utterly false,
for they have never even heard the slightest rumour corroborative
of this absurd report. On my flight from Kordofan, I heard on my
arrival at Tara, on the White River, that an European was residing
at the chief town of the Shilluk, with a strong escort, to catch
eight hippopotami for Mehemed Ali, and to prepare their skins, to
stuff them, in fact, as specimens for a museum. I immediately set
out on my journey from Tara, and after a long march of two tedious
days on a camel, reached the scene of action, where I certainly
found the hippopotamus hunters; but the European, whose name was
Bartolo, had left a few days before my arrival, for Khartoom, on
the eastern shore. During my sojourn among the Shilluks, I assisted
at a hippopotamus hunt; five had been already killed, but they were
so carelessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
dissected, that I felt sure they would not keep for any length of
time; in fact, they very soon spoiled, and are now lying quite
useless at Cairo. On this occasion, I had an opportunity of
becoming more intimately acquainted with the Shilluks, as far in
fact as my residence among them would permit it. I found that they
are in their own country, quite as idle as they are in captivity
abroad; they may be seen loitering about, but never by any chance
at work. During the hot season they do not sleep in their huts, but
in the open air, old and young congregating together like a herd of
cattle. The Shilluks walk about in a state of complete nudity, and
only when they are married cover their loins with a strip of
cotton-stuff. The majority of them wear merely a piece of calico of
the size of a hand to cover their nakedness. Their women are very
ill-used. The cause of this ill-treatment is, generally,
superstition: thus, if the husband whilst hunting miss his aim with
his spear, or tread a thorn into his foot, his wife must bear the
blame; he accuses her of having at the moment of his disaster, been
unfaithful, and there is no help for her, she must undergo
chastisement. If the adultery be proved, and a complaint be made to
the Sheikh, she receives three strokes on the head with a crooked
stick, one in the centre and one at either side of the head, such
unmerciful blows indeed, that the blood instantly gushes forth.
These punishments are of very frequent occurrence, for<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> adultery is not uncommon among
the Shilluks.<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>The products they obtain from the ground may be regarded as a
mere nothing. They cultivate as much dokn as they believe
sufficient to last from one harvest to the next. On the possibility
of a failure of the harvest, they never bestow a thought, nor do
they pay any consideration to other contingencies, by laying in
stores. Their cattle is said to be numerous in some few places, but
is reared without the slightest care or attendance. They have no
salt in their own country, and are obliged, therefore, to obtain it
from Sennaar or Kordofan; but the greater portion of the
inhabitants have never tasted this condiment. All other
necessaries, which they might produce with little trouble
themselves, they obtain by barter from their neighbours, giving
articles in exchange which nature brings forth without the
assistance of art. This tribe is, taken all in all, the very <i>ne
plus ultra</i> of idleness and stupidity, and they differ but
immaterially from animals. They are consequently not as dangerous
to travellers as other tribes, who are always on the alert for
prey, and but few robbers by profession live among their hills; the
other Shilluks, moreover, always warn the Djelabi travelling
through their country not to approach the infested<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> neighbourhoods. Their chief
wealth consists in ivory, which they likewise obtain in certain
parts of their dominions without the slightest trouble. They
arrange the teeth in rows, forming a fence round their huts, and
barter them away to the Djelabi when they come into their parts.
There are many elephants in the country wandering about in herds of
several hundreds each; they are, however, met with singly, during
the greater portion of the year. It is only at a certain
period—generally before the rain sets in—that they collect together
in herds, and then they cross the White Nile in the direction of
Fazoglo. An old female elephant is always the leader, and
determines on the spot for crossing the stream. This movement is
effected with a fearful noise, as may be easily imagined when so
large a number of these moving mountains are known to be swimming
in the river at the same time. They draw up a quantity of water in
their proboscis, and spurt it forth again like a fountain, thus
appearing to convert a large extent of the water in which they
carry on their pranks into a sort of whirlpool. Notwithstanding
their immense weight they swim with incredible facility, and I have
been assured that when these animals cross the river singly, the
water remains frequently undisturbed, so that the unwieldy mass
appears to be moved by some invisible power. Whilst on their
journey, the emigrants observe the strictest order; their leader, a
female, turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
frequently round and raises a cry if an elephant stray, to recall
him to the ranks again. A herd frequently takes its route directly
through a village, without doing the slightest injury to the huts,
or to the inhabitants; singly they never do any harm. Several of
these elephants always remain behind their companions; for they
feel a presentiment of their approaching end, and then choose a
solitary valley in the neighbourhood of the river, where they
patiently await their death, which generally takes place before the
large herds return from their migrations. No one ever disturbs
them, for death generally overtakes them in a short time, and then
they fall a certain prey to the negroes. Hunting expeditions are,
indeed, occasionally instituted against these animals, but only
whilst they are to be met with singly, and dispersed over the
country; for when they have collected together in herd it would be
attended with great danger to attack them. Ivory is the only
commodity of trade in these regions.</p>

<p>Beside ivory, a small quantity of gold-dust is to be met with,
among some few of the Shilluks, and yet more among the Jenky; they
fetch it from the mountains of the Blue River, but these simple
people do not know its real value, and trouble themselves very
little about looking after it. The Djelabi transact the most
business with them. The present Sultan of the Shilluks is named
Denap; his wealth consists in elephants’ tusks. I was told by
several Djelabi that there existed an animal in<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> the country of the Shilluks,
totally unknown in Kordofan and Sennaar. The natives call it
<em>denk</em>; it is said to be rather larger than a rat, of an
ash-grey colour, and to resemble a monkey in shape; the fore and
hind paws, they say, are like the hands and feet of man; the tail
is very short. This animal feeds on gum, climbs the trees, but
cannot jump from branch to branch like the monkey. There are no
camels in the country, on account of that destructive fly called
here Yohara.</p>

<p>At a distance of about twenty or thirty hours’ march southward
and to the south-east of Lobeid, the free negroes live, who are in
part tributary to Kordofan; the tribute, however, is always levied
by force from these tribes. They resemble each other perfectly in
stature and features, but converse in different languages—thus, in
one day’s march, many different dialects and languages may be heard
spoken: it would appear, however, that the language of the Takale,
Kodero, and Schabun are of the same root. The largest tribe with
which I am acquainted calls itself Nuba, and occupies a large
extent of the mountainous tract. The Nuba are republicans, and
recognise no superior authority beyond their particular sheikh,
who, however, plays a passive part only, for his jurisdiction does
not extend beyond the confines of one village. Even one of these
chiefs, if obnoxious to the greater number, is immediately deprived
of his dignity, and superseded by another sheikh, elected by a
majority of votes. It is for this<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> same reason, that a magistrate of this
description dare not enforce his decisions: thus the opinion of the
multitude prevails. It has frequently happened that a sheikh, who
had acquired authority among this tribe by his personal advantages,
or by his wealth, has at last had the intention of usurping the
authority of sultan or monarch of all the Nuba; but this attempt
has never yet succeeded, for the unfortunate usurper was
immediately put to death as soon as the Nuba negroes had the
slightest suspicion of this project. Their sheikhs, therefore, are
mere ciphers, only to be tolerated as long as they do not interfere
with the freedom and privileges of the subject.</p>

<p>All the negro tribes inhabiting the country, extending to about
the tenth degree of latitude, are easily to be distinguished from
each other, some by their ear-rings and nose-rings, some again by
the loss of the lower incisor teeth, others by a hole in the under
lip, into which they insert the tooth of some animal, which adheres
in the aperture; others, again, are tattooed about the face. These
negroes have all perfectly woolly hair, which covers the head but
sparingly; thick everted lips, and small compressed noses. Many of
them are less black than the negroes inhabiting the southern
regions, have not the high projecting cheek-bones, and are, on an
average, a well-made race of men. The girls have fine breasts,
convex from below upwards, and superiorly rather concave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>These Nuba
reside in villages, which they build chiefly in the most
inaccessible parts of the mountains, and put in the best possible
state of defence. Their dwellings are made of straw, hedged in with
thorns, and some of the houses are built of stone. I must, however,
observe, that those tribes which are under monarchic government
live more peaceably than the republicans, who frequently go to war
for trifles, when the stronger tribes make prisoners of the weaker,
and sell them as slaves.</p>

<p>The climate of these districts is far more healthy than that of
Kordofan. The dress of the natives is very simple. Only the
grown-up people wear a piece of cotton stuff; the majority wear
only a strip about as broad as the hand, passing a cord round their
hips, with which they fasten it to the abdomen and back. In
addition to this simple hip-cloth, they decorate themselves with
ear-rings of brass or iron wire, and the women wear necklaces of
Bohemian and Venetian glass beads. Some of the men wear a ribbon,
about an ell in length, round their loins.<a id=
"FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
This ornament costs immense patience and no less trouble in its
manufacture: it consists of a number of small buttons of about the
size of a shirt-button, made of the shell of the ostrich’s egg,
with a perforation in the centre, through which a string is passed,
connecting them together. I took the trouble of counting the single
buttons of one of these ribbons in my<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_157">[157]</span> possession, and found a total number of six
thousand eight hundred and sixty. Above and below they are
frequently ornamented with small iron pins and glass beads. If we
consider that these men possess no sharp cutting instruments to
facilitate their labour, we may readily understand that great
patience is required in the manufacture of one of these girdles. On
some of the hills of the Nuba mountains the women dye their hair of
a red colour, by reducing a species of red sandstone to a fine
powder, which they mix with butter, and thus form a pomatum, with
which they anoint their curls; it generally remains for a few days
adherent to the hair, and gives them no very pleasing appearance.
Incisions are made into the cheeks, arms, breasts, and bodies of
the girls, by way of ornament. The household furniture of the Nuba
negroes is very mean; it consists merely of a few pots, for water,
for merissa and for cooking; and of a few drinking cups, made of
gourds: the latter filled with water, serve the women in lieu of
mirrors, which the girls frequently resort to during the day.</p>

<p>The arms of the men, which they always carry about them, and
scarcely ever lay aside, are a shield, spears with iron or wooden
points, the latter always poisoned; a small double-edged knife; and
a kind of scythe, consisting of a cutting blade, which is at first
straight, but then cordiform in its curve, and about two feet in
length. This weapon they denominate a Turbatsch, and use it in
battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> for warding
off sabre-cuts, and throw it also at the feet of the enemy in an
attack.</p>

<p>Their favourite occupation is tobacco smoking: they are, indeed,
never to be met during the whole day without a pipe in their
mouths. The young girls seldom smoke, but the old women never put
their pipes aside for one moment; and when several of them squat
down together, and form, as in other places, a clique for scandal,
you might imagine yourself to be in a chimney. The bowls of the
tobacco-pipes of these Nuba negroes are made of clay or wood, and
they give them a very pleasing appearance. The pipe is manufactured
of wood, and is of about the thickness of a finger—into this they
insert a thin iron tube, three inches in length, which serves the
purpose of a mouth-piece. They grow their own tobacco—it resembles
that of Kordofan, has a small leaf, and thick stalk. It is very
probable that the negroes have smoked from time immemorial, and
that tobacco, therefore, does not come originally from America
alone.</p>

<p>The food of the Nuba negroes is far better than that of the
natives of Kordofan, for on many of the hills there is an abundance
of oxen, goats, sheep, pigs, fowls, butter, and honey. Amongst
their favourite dishes rats must be classed, which are considered a
great delicacy on several of the hills. The species eaten is the
field rat, and has not the same disgusting appearance as that of
Europe. It is roasted here on a spit in its skin, and is
subsequently flayed.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_159">[159]</span> Besides the above-mentioned animals, game,
which is met with in abundance on their hills, serves as an article
of food, and they are very expert in catching young giraffes,
ostriches, hares, and various kinds of antelopes, in snares, for
their own consumption. Bread forms one of their chief wants, they,
therefore, pay great attention to agriculture. It frequently
happens that a drought destroys the harvest, or that it is eaten up
by the locusts, so common in these regions, or, what is more likely
still, that it falls a prey to the predatory Turks, when a great
dearth of bread, which is of the most frightful consequence, is
generally the result; instances are then known of parents selling
their children for a few handfulls of dockn. I myself saw a girl
whom a Djelabi had bought for fifty handfulls of grain. A brother
will, on these occasions, sell his sister to obtain a little flour,
and thus to supply himself and his people with bread for a few
days. One Djelabi received eight oxen for a camel-load of dockn,
consisting of about three cantars; and another merchant bought
eight children at the same price. In these calamitous times, the
price of a man, therefore, is equal to that of a beast. It is very
astonishing that a famine should ever exist with the abundance of
animal food they possess; but it is nevertheless certain that,
during scarcity of corn, these negroes will despise every other
food, and rather suffer every species of misery. Whenever this
famine exists, the consequences are always very fearful; for the
Nuba negroes then sally<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_160">[160]</span> forth in quest of prey into the
neighbouring villages, where they plunder and steal everything they
can lay their hands upon. These depredations give rise to many
quarrels, which always lead to a war, and the conflict lasts until
the weaker party is overcome, when they are all sold by the
conquerors as slaves.</p>

<p>The chief exports of the Nuba consist in gum, ostrich feathers,
tamarinds, honey, and slaves, with all of which they carry on a
trade by barter. No one troubles himself about the gum since
Mehemed Ali has monopolized the trade, for the freight to Kordofan
would cost double the amount which he pays for it; hence thousands
of cantari of gum, which might afford a maintenance to as many
hundreds of families, are annually allowed to rot. The Nuba negroes
do not know the value of money, and always accept such goods as
they reckon among their wants for their commodities. The Djelabi
generally import cottons, brass, and iron wire, glass beads,
counters, &amp;c., and exchange them for the articles above
specified. The barter among themselves consists in tobacco, salt,
and small shells. In the neighbourhood of Schabun the negroes
collect gold, which they find in the mountain torrents, and keep in
the quills of large birds of prey; but they attach no great
importance to this metal, for they do not know its value. The
Dongolavi only, who have immigrated into these regions, since time
immemorial, for the purpose of trading, and have become residents
there, draw considerable profit from that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_161">[161]</span> source. This gold is met with in commerce
in Kordofan in quills; it is frequently preferred to ready money,
and is also cast into rings. It would appear that the negroes at
Shabun possess no fireproof crucibles to melt the metal, as is the
case with the other negroes and Galla tribes. The Dongolavis have
in several places intermarried with negro girls, whence a mixed
language, as I am told, has originated: they, however, preserve the
characteristics of the father, and a Dongolavi, although born of a
negro mother, may be immediately recognized.</p>

<p>The Nuba negroes are for the most part heathens, and only very
few of them profess the Mahommedan faith. Their ideas of religion,
in general, are very limited, and they observe scarcely any
ceremonies of worship. They believe, indeed, in a superior being,
but it ranks below the moon, and hence it comes that the end of the
lunar month is especially kept holy. Many of them again imagine
that the sun, which produces the rain, is the superior being,
because nothing can grow without rain. They can accurately
determine the period when the rainy season will begin, and count
from the commencement of each month. They are not idolators, but
are by no means free from superstition, for before entering upon
any undertaking or business, they wait for certain omina, according
to which they regulate their actions. If, for example, an owl perch
upon a house in the night and utter its melancholy note, they
consider it a certain sign that one of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_162">[162]</span> inhabitants will shortly die. A raven makes
a still stronger impression upon these simple beings; should it, as
of course frequently occurs, happen to fly into a village and
settle on a tree or house, the whole place is then in
consternation, all cheerfulness disappears, song and music cease to
be heard, and even dancing is put a stop to on this woful day, for
the arrival of a raven is a sure sign to them, that the Turks are
coming to plunder them, or even to carry them off as slaves. They
believe firmly in ghosts. On some of the hills they celebrate the
anniversary of their dead, and indeed, at a certain time, annually.
A large fire is on this occasion kindled in an open space, in the
evening, whence every man takes a burning branch in his hand as a
torch, and thus the procession moves first to the place of burial,
and then to those houses in which some person had died during the
preceding year. A song is now commenced in honour of the dead, at
the conclusion of which, they toss their burning branches into the
air, much after the same fashion in which midsummer is celebrated
in certain countries of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> A festival is kept when
the first rain falls, and again at the termination of the harvest.
To celebrate the latter feast, everything the house affords which
could enliven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> the
festive scene is contributed, and merissa, of course, flows in
abundance. Their favourite amusements are singing and dancing,
every one who is in any way capable of exercise, dances, both men
and women, and frequently even the aged and infirm, join in; no day
in fact passes, on which the whole population of the village do not
collect in an open space after sunset and pass their time in
dancing. The accompaniment consists in singing, in beating time
with their hands to the sounds of a drum, and the tones of a fife
are frequently also added. The young girls more especially may be
heard singing all day long, for they never perform any office be it
ever so trivial, without the accompaniment of the voice. As soon as
the sun disappears behind the hills, large fires are lighted in all
the villages, and dancing begins; whilst songs are re-echoed from
hill to hill, producing the effect of a kind of vocal response or
salutation.</p>

<p>These Nuba are of a more amiable disposition than might be
expected of a people in a state of semi-barbarity, and if they be
only convinced that a traveller has no intention of doing them
harm, he may make sure of the most hospitable reception,
notwithstanding the ill-treatment and oppression they occasionally
suffer from the neighbouring Turks, which has imbued them with an
almost incontrovertible hatred towards all white men. The slave
merchants greatly contribute to keep up this aversion by assuring
the negroes, that all the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_164">[164]</span> captives who fall into the hands of the
white men are fattened in their country for slaughter. When the
Djelabi have reached Kordofan and set out on their journey to
Cairo, they make the poor slaves understand that those white men
who, like the Arabs and Turks, profess the true faith, do not eat
the flesh of the negroes; but that the <em>Giaours</em>, or
unbelievers, by which denomination they distinguish the Franks,
follow that barbarous custom. This will account for the
circumstance of slaves so frequently beginning to cry when
purchased by a Frank at Cairo, they are, in fact, seized with the
fear of being led to the shambles. A Nuba negro, who spoke Arabic
well, said to me once very coolly: “We black men are far better
than you white men, for when our children come into your country
you slaughter them; we could do the same with you, but we are
charitable and do not act thus, therefore we are better than you.”
With kindness every thing may be obtained from these children of
nature, whilst harshness and severity produce the opposite effect;
for as soon as they perceive that force is about to be employed,
they become passionate and malicious and obstinate to a degree, for
they are children of freedom, and will rather forfeit their lives
than tolerate coercion. In requiring a service of them it is
necessary to make considerate representations to them, and to use
the utmost caution to keep them in a good humour, for in the
contrary case evil consequences<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_165">[165]</span> are alone to be expected; they will,
indeed, rather suffer death than allow themselves to be forced by
ill-treatment to the performance of even the most trivial
office.</p>

<p>Polygamy is not a general custom, each man takes to himself only
one or two women; the sheikhs alone have several wives. When a man
is about to lead a girl away as his wife, he treats first with the
father concerning the price at which he will deliver her up. The
amount of course varies much, and depends on the youth, beauty, and
other advantageous qualifications of the chosen bride. The dowry
consists generally in a certain number of cows, goats, or sheep,
which become the personal property of the newly-married woman. As
soon as the agreement and business transactions are settled, the
bridegroom proceeds, accompanied by all the young men in the
village, to the hut of his selected wife, who is delivered by the
mother and nearest relations, with some simple ceremonies, to the
bridegroom; and he now leads her with song, drums, and fifes, into
his own hut, where a feast is prepared for all his guests. In
conclusion there is a ball at which all assist, and thus the
marriage festivities terminate. In their family circles these
negroes live very peaceably, and if a case ever occur that a
husband for any reason separate from his wife, she goes back to her
parents, keeps her marriage portion, and takes every thing she has
received from her husband away with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Their
agricultural pursuits are very profitable to them, and require very
little labour, as the soil is uncommonly fertile; hence their
occupations in the fields during the time of sowing and of the
harvest are terminated in an incredibly short space of time, and
they have nothing to do but to rake up the weeds with the
<em>hasseiaseh</em>, in the intermediate space between the two
former seasons. After the first fall of rain they hasten to the
fields and plant the dockn; this is done in the same manner as in
Kordofan, and will be explained hereafter in the twelfth chapter.
Tobacco is largely cultivated, for they are inordinately addicted
to smoking. When the plant has arrived at its full growth the
leaves are gathered and dried, and after having been subjected to a
process of damping, are formed into the shape of a cake. When the
negroes are about to smoke they break off a piece of the size
required, rub it to powder between their hands, and fill their
pipes. Their tobacco is very potent, so that an European is, in
fact, obliged to soak it in water for twenty-four hours before he
can use it to render it more mild; and even then he will find it
too acrid, and it almost amounts to an impossibility to smoke two
of their short pipes successively. They barter away this product.
The whole of their husbandry is comprised in the cultivation of
these two articles, and in the interval between the sowing season
and the harvest their occupation consists merely in rearing cattle,
in hunting, and throwing spears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The business
attended with the greatest trouble to them is the collection of
honey, for though they are in a state of nudity and totally
uncovered, they use no means of defence against the sting of the
angry bees. In taking a hive, therefore, they must endeavour to
drive the bees away as far as this is practicable with branches of
trees, before they can get at their produce; but notwithstanding
these and other precautionary measures, the little animals,
infuriated at the invasion of their peaceful dwellings, generally
beset the uninvited guest in swarms, and vent the whole force of
their anger on him; the intruder has no alternative but to throw
himself on the ground and writhe in the sand, but the effects of
the punishment inflicted are always severely felt for several hours
afterwards.</p>

<p>The military exercise of the Nubas consists chiefly in throwing
spears, and covering the body with the shield in defence. For this
practice they make use of the stalks of the dockn, which they throw
at each other with much accuracy, seldom or never missing their
aim; but they are, on the other hand, so well versed in the use of
their shields that they generally ward off the missile and receive
the blow on it, or rolling themselves almost into the form of a
ball, cover the whole body with their shields. Their attacks are
always attended with a frightful noise, augmented by the shrieks of
the women in the back ground, and follow with such
rapidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> that the
party attacked has but little time for consideration, or for
placing himself on his guard. If the first shock, however, be well
sustained, and a bold front be offered, they retreat as rapidly as
they advanced, and do not so soon again venture on a second charge,
but confine themselves to skirmishing. Their battles amongst each
other are always terrific, nor do they terminate until the one or
other party is brought to subjection, whereupon the prisoners are
all sold as slaves. But these Nuba negroes have, in addition to
their own tribes, two classes of far more dreaded enemies, namely,
the Turks and the Bakkara; the former take them away by force as
slaves, and the latter by stratagem; they are, therefore,
continually prepared for an attack, and keep up their watchfires
all night long, to avoid being thrown into confusion during
darkness.</p>

<p>Their fires even are frequently a source of annoyance and
trouble to them, for as they possess no means of generating this
element, they must be very careful never to allow it to go out. In
cases of this disastrous occurrence, or when engaged in hunting, or
in other occupations, at a great distance from their villages, they
resort to the following primitive method for striking a light. They
take two dry pieces of wood, in the one of which they cut a hole
with a knife, or sharp-pointed stone, barely large enough to admit
the other; they then lay the former on the ground, holding it
firmly in that position with their feet, fit the second piece into
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> perforation,
and rub the two together with extraordinary rapidity, throwing a
few grains of sand occasionally into the hole to augment the
friction. This is a labour demanding great exertion, and two
persons are always necessary for its performance. A handfull of dry
grass, or an old piece of cotton rag, is placed beneath the wood to
catch the sparks, and glows as soon as the wood is converted into
coal. Dried grass and sticks are now added, when the combustible
materials are fanned into a living flame. In Kordofan the same
custom prevails. If all the fires be extinguished in a small
village during the rainy season, the inhabitants are indeed put to
the greatest embarrassment, especially where the distance to the
nearest village is great, because all the grass and wood is then
very wet. A Shilluk told me that in his village, which was situated
at a distance of ten hours’ march from any other inhabited spot,
they were once not able to produce a fire during twenty days. The
inhabitants had made frequent attempts to transport a burning
branch from the nearest locality, and had lighted more than fifty
fires in the intervening space, in order to bring it gradually into
their own village; but the showers had, on four different
occasions, frustrated their endeavours when they were on the point
of succeeding. Soft wood is useless for procuring a light, and
there was no hard wood in that neighbourhood. I was myself once put
to a very great inconvenience whilst at Lobeid for want of a flint,
for there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> not
one to be purchased in the bazaar at any price; my servant,
however, soon invented a remedy: he went up to a soldier, a Shilluk
of course, and bought the flint of his musket, which he unscrewed
whilst on duty, and delivered at the high price of four-pence
halfpenny.</p>

<p>The dominions of Takele are situated at a distance of about five
days’ journey to the south-east of Kordofan; they are governed by a
sultan, who is an absolute monarch, and has his residence at
Tassin.</p>

<p>This sultan, and the greater part of his subjects, are of the
Mahommedan persuasion. In former times, when Kordofan and all these
realms were subject to Darfour, Takele paid tribute to that
government, and even after Mehemed Ali had taken possession of
Kordofan, sword in hand, the fine was annually paid, it being taken
for granted that the conquerors should enjoy the same rights as the
former administration. But when the Turks, not contented with the
tribute, subsequently sought to put their golden rule of raising
the taxation into practice, looking upon everything in the country
as their own property, the Sultan of Takele refused to submit, and
opposed their claims in person with an armed force. Mehemed Ali
undertook three ineffective campaigns against this country, and was
at last obliged to give up the project, after having lost more than
half of the forces employed in the expedition. Takele possesses
many irregular troops, which proved very galling to the Egyptians;
for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> always
took the unsuspecting Turks by surprise, and, after having put them
to the rout, fled again into their hills, where the former dare not
venture to pursue them. The commander-in-chief of the Egyptian
forces revenged himself by destroying all the crops which happened
to be standing at the time, by fire, and thus the war terminated;
for when the Turks saw that nothing was to be gained by plunder
they retreated, and no attack has since that period been made upon
Takele.</p>

<p>The Djelabi, from Lobeid and Bara, are allowed to carry on their
trade with the country without interruption, as are also those of
Takele with Kordofan; for several Dongolavi from Kordofan have
settled in this country, as it affords them many advantages. Takele
is hilly in its whole extent, and is said to be traversed by a
chain of mountains, two full days’ journey in length, considered
there as one hill. The natives of Takele, in forming an estimate of
the magnitude of their dominions, generally reckon by the number of
hills which are inhabited; thus they say that Takele has
ninety-nine inhabited hills, and that the Nubas have one hill more,
and reckon one hundred; hence we may conclude that Nuba is larger
than Takele. These numerals, however, must not be taken literally,
for they denote every large number, if it exceed thirty, by the
term ninety-nine; and say (<i>e. g.</i>), instead of forty or
eighty sheep, ninety-nine heads of cattle. I have myself met with
negroes from distant parts, whose whole<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_172">[172]</span> knowledge of arithmetic was limited to
“five,” named after the five fingers; thus the thumb was one, the
forefinger two, the middle-finger three, and so forth. A question
put to men of this limited knowledge, entailing a definite number,
is an affair attended with great difficulty, and it is indeed
impossible to obtain a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>The natives of this country are far more industrious than those
of Kordofan, and pay much greater attention to agriculture, and the
cultivation of cotton, than their neighbours; they also manufacture
the cotton themselves into stuffs, and produce other articles of
commerce. They have few, but very beautiful horses; and a man must
be a bold as well as an excellent rider to keep his seat on these
spirited animals, which the natives prize very highly, for they
will not readily part with them. In fact, an opportunity only
offers itself of purchasing one of their horses when, in a
depredatory invasion by the Bakkara, or in a conflict with their
neighbours, a man of Takele has been killed, and his horse becomes
the booty of the conqueror. I believe that the pedigree of these
horses must be sought in Darfour. These negroes hunt elephants, and
carry on a trade in ivory with Kordofan. In those parts of the
country where there are no horses the elephants are caught in pits,
but where the inhabitants possess horses the following plan is
pursued:—Two men, mounted on horseback, go hunting together, and
generally pick out a full-sized<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_173">[173]</span> elephant, because the larger animals prove
the more profitable. When they have discovered an elephant, one man
rides at a distance of about a hundred paces in front of him, so
that he keeps in full view of the beast. The other rider approaches
to within a hundred paces of the animal from behind, dismounts from
his horse,—for he is sure that it will stand quietly,—stealthily
approaches it from the rear, and with one cut with a sharp sabre,
severs the back sinews of its heel-joint. Infuriated to the utmost
by the violent pain, and seeing the rider before it, the animal
rushes instantly in pursuit of him, whilst the man who inflicted
the wound gains time to vault upon his horse, and make off. The
elephant cannot follow the rider far, partly because the latter has
the advantage of a start,—and the horse is, moreover, fleeter than
the elephant,—partly because he is, in a certain measure, lamed;
thus he ultimately treads off his foot, and sinks exhausted with
the loss of blood, an easy prey to the huntsman.</p>

<p>As fire-arms are not yet known in this country, the natives slay
lions in the following manner:—They trace out the lair where one of
these animals generally takes its noonday repose; but the nature of
the ground must be such, that the tree under which it sleeps is
isolated, or at least somewhat distant from the other trees. If the
ground be advantageous, the negro betakes himself to the scene of
action four hours before mid-day, and climbs<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_174">[174]</span> the tree opposite to that under which
the animal takes its nap. During this time he knows the lion to be
out in search of prey, and is sure that he will return to indulge
in his siesta when the heat increases, between ten and eleven
o’clock. The lion does not trouble himself about the business of
the man on the tree, even if he should happen to see him; and his
adversary remains perfectly quiet till between twelve and one. The
huntsman is furnished with a sackfull of small stones, and a few
sharp spears. When the sand on the ground is burning hot, so that
animals even cannot walk about, the hunter begins to pelt the lion
with stones, always aiming at his head, and the negroes are very
expert marksmen. The proud king of the beasts utterly disregards
the first three or four stones, and does not consider it even worth
his while to rise; but the blows upon his head thickening, and
being, perhaps, hit in the eye, the audacity appears too great to
be borne with patience, and he sets up a frightful roar as a signal
of revenge. With one leap he is at the foot of the tree on which
the disturber of his rest is perched, but receives a lance in his
body; his roar now becomes more terrific, not that the wound is so
irritating to him at this moment as the burning sand painful to his
feet, and he retires once more to his lair. Another stone hits him,
he becomes furious, makes a second charge at the tree, and is
welcomed by one, two, or more spears. He now takes to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> flight, yelling and howling
with pain; but the loss of blood soon exhausts his strength, and
the huntsman, who keeps him in sight from the tree, has, in a very
short time, the pleasure of seeing the royal beast stretch its
carcase on the plains.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Takele are a well made race of men, and all
those I met with were of very pleasing countenance. Their dress is
like that of the other negroes, the more opulent only wearing white
and blue shirts. Their habits and customs are said to be the same
as those among the Nuba, some few Mahommedans merely forming the
exception. The sultan is reported to be an exceedingly good man,
and all those who have the honour of his acquaintance speak highly
in his favour; he is, indeed, almost adored by his subjects, none
of which approach him, otherwise than kneeling, and murmuring a
prayer into their hands, nor do they venture to rise, or to sit
down, before the sultan has given them permission. The divan, in
which he holds his audience, is a large saloon built of stone,
decorated with swords, spears, and other warlike trophies,
eighteen, or twenty, of his body-guard are always present, they
sit, armed with spears, cross-legged, in the centre of the saloon,
and form a kind of living fence. The sultan proceeds every morning,
with sunrise, immediately after prayers, into the divan, hears all
causes himself, and issues his decision immediately. He is fond of
hunting, and of his women, three<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_176">[176]</span> hundred of which he is said to keep in his
harem, a stone building, situate on the summit of a rock at Tassin,
very difficult of access, which has, moreover, only one approach.
The brother of the Sultan of Takele, whom a Djelabi of my
acquaintance brought to my house at Lobeid, wore merely a blue
shirt, and sandals, and not even a Táckeyeéh<a id=
"FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
on his head.</p>

<p>It was formerly my intention to undertake a journey into Takele,
as no European has ever yet set foot into that country. This was
the chief reason why I sought the acquaintance of the Prince of
Takele, who came every year to Lobeid. He visited me daily during
his sojourn in the capital, gave me every information respecting
his country, and assured me that his brother, the sultan, would
with pleasure receive me in his states, where I should have nothing
to fear, as it was his most ardent wish to make the acquaintance of
a Frank. The governor, and Turkish officers, however, dissuaded me
from my project, assuring me that I should be exposed to all manner
of dangers, as the Turks are hated in Takele, and every white man,
without distinction, is considered an Osmanlee. Hence, I was
necessitated to relinquish my plan, and to confine myself to the
information I received from this prince, and the Djelabis, who had
travelled in the country. I have since, however, convinced myself
that these apprehensions, created by the officiousness of
others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> were
totally unfounded, and that an European might visit Takele without
any danger, through the intermediation of the brother of the
sultan, or a Djelabi, by merely previously forwarding, through one
of the opportunities named, a small present to the sultan, who
would then send an escort to the borders, under which the journey
might be continued with safety. Above all things, however, it would
be necessary to make the acquaintance of one or the other of the
persons mentioned, that they might become security that the
traveller was a Frank, and not a Turkish spy. The prince, above
mentioned, assured me that his brother was very anxious to receive
an European visitor, for the express object of learning something
from him, and, more especially, to receive instruction in tactics.
This offer would be very acceptable to many military men; for I am
convinced that the Sultan of Takele would treat an instructor of
this description very well, who would, moreover, have the
opportunity of collecting authentic information respecting the
country, and, probably, also concerning the neighbouring states.
The prince, who very frequently visited me, endeavoured to persuade
me in every possible way to travel with him to Takele; and I had
already overcome all fears, and was about to venture on the
journey, when I was forced by circumstances to alter my plans. I
made the chief a present of a tarboósh<a id=
"FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
some time before his departure, which he wore all the time he
passed at Lobeid; but on the day of his departure he brought it
back to me, begging me to keep it for him until he returned, as he
dare not wear it in Takele, because his brother, the sultan, had
none.</p>

<p>At the head of the irregular troops is a general, or seraskeer,
as the Turks call him, who is, indeed, chosen by the sultan, but
obliged to distinguish himself, in accordance with the custom of
the country, by some feat of bravery, to prove himself worthy of
the dignity of that office. This feat is generally an incursion
into one or the other of the neighbouring states, or some other
proof of personal valour and intrepidity. The ordeal, however, does
not always turn out to the advantage of the aspirant, for, in the
year 1838, the commander-in-chief of the troops of Takele, who was
already elected, fell a victim to his feat of heroism. He crossed
the borders with about a hundred men armed with spears, and
attacked the nearest Bakkara tribe, and was to put his heroism to
the test on a Mogghrebeen who happened to be present. The general,
armed with a broadsword, charged the Mogghrebeen on horseback,
waved his sabre in the air, and thought, with one single blow, to
put an end to the poor native of the desert; but the latter,
although on foot and armed merely with a pistol, cleverly avoided
the impending blow, and laid the valorous general
prostrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> with a
pistol-ball. The invading party, seeing their leader slain,
immediately took to flight, and the Bedouins became the possessors
of the horse and arms of the defunct general. A slight idea may
thus be formed of the state of the army of Takele.</p>

<p>Slaves are also exported from Takele, which these negroes
capture in the wars with their neighbours, but they themselves are,
in their turn, not spared, and suffer greatly, partly by the
predatory Bakkara, partly by their own countrymen, who devise all
manner of means to kidnap their children by force or stratagem, and
to sell them to the slave merchants. I myself met with a girl, in
the house of an European at Cairo, who had been stolen, together
with her younger sister, from the paternal roof, in a manner which
must cause the utmost astonishment at the subtlety and cunning of
these uncivilized children of nature. This story may also serve as
a proof of the manner in which these poor blacks are everywhere
treated.</p>

<p>A slave, who had been stolen in Takele, bought by a Turk in
Khartoom, and liberated on the death of his master, as is
frequently the case, returned to his home. The sheikh of the place,
a native of Abyssinia, who had come to settle in those parts at an
early age, and had adopted the Mahommedan religion from love for a
negro girl, received this slave hospitably into his house, and
completely provided for him, for his parents were dead, and he had
no other relations living.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_180">[180]</span> He remained, during several months, in the
sheikh’s house, where he ingratiated himself, by his pleasing
manners so much with all the inhabitants, but more especially with
the children, that he was not treated like a stranger, but regarded
as a member of the family. One day he was left alone with the
children at home, the sheikh’s wife being called away to visit a
sick friend in a hut that was rather distant, while the sheikh
himself was at work in the fields. He amused the children, for some
time, with a variety of games, then left them for a short interval,
and, on his return, invited the eldest daughter, a girl of eleven
years of age, and her sister, who was rather younger, to accompany
him to fetch their mother. The children, not suspecting any harm,
acceded, with delight, to his proposition, and left the house in
his company. He immediately led them out of the village, pretending
to show them a nearer way to the hut of their mother’s friend. On
the road, he endeavoured to divert the attention of the girls, by
relating stories, showing them flowers, and plucking fruit for
them, in order that they might not observe that he was leading them
on an unbeaten track. After several hours, passed with many
consolatory assurances, they arrived in an open country, at a
forest, where several men lay hidden among the bushes, and were
feeding their horses. The ungrateful villain now again assured the
children that he would soon conduct them<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_181">[181]</span> to their parent in the company of all these
men, and gave them some refreshments. When the night closed in,
more horsemen arrived, and they all immediately set out on their
march. The robber took the two girls on his horse, the youngest in
front of him, and the eldest behind, again protesting that he would
very soon bring them to their mother, who was already waiting for
them. The whole night through they rode in the forest and to
prevent the girls, who, overcome with fatigue, had fallen asleep,
from slipping off his horse, he bound them both with a rope to his
body. The younger girl still believed they were going to their
home, but the elder began to scream and cry, and complained
bitterly that she knew they had both been stolen and were to be
sold as slaves. The barbarian now changed his conduct; he beat the
poor girls about the head and face, and threatened to murder them,
if they uttered another note. Thus they travelled on during four
nights, for by day these Bakkara robbers—such they proved to
be—were obliged to hide in the woods, or other desolate places, to
avoid being seen and attacked by the natives. At last they reached
an encampment of Egyptian troops. The kidnapper now led the two
girls to the commanding officer, and made him a present of them, of
course against a present of equal worth. The officer, moved to pity
by the tears of these two children, endeavoured to pacify them,
offered them refreshment, and asked them whence they came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>When they had
told the Turk the name of their father and their place of
residence, and at the same time related the manner in which this
ungrateful wretch had stolen them from their paternal roof, he
became enraged, and ordered the robber a <i>bastinado</i> of
several hundred stripes. He quieted the sobs of the children, and
promised to send them home again, and told them their father had
arrived the day before in the camp, but hastened back home again,
to seek them elsewhere, as he had not found them there. It so
happened that the Egyptian officer was a friend of their father’s,
who had done him a great service some few years before. He
immediately summoned a subaltern into his presence, and put the two
girls under his care, with orders to take them back to their
father, and give him notice of his arrival at the borders. The
subordinate mounted a camel, took charge of the girls, and
delighted them with the assurance that they should reach the
borders of Takele in two days, and that he would there find some
safe opportunity of sending them to their parent; but how were they
deceived on their arrival at Khartoom, after ten days, when they
observed a town totally unknown to them, and when this second
robber showed himself in his true colours! He hastened immediately
to the blue Nile, and hired a boat for the remainder of his journey
to Cairo; but he was here arrested and carried before the governor.
On being questioned whence he came, and by whose authority he was
escorting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> these
slaves, he pretended to have received orders from the officer
commanding the troops of the borders to convey the girls to Cairo.
The governor demanded a proof in writing, but the corporal
pretended to have lost his passport. This circumstance, and the
assertion of the twice-stolen girls, corroborating the suspicion
that he had kidnapped them, and deserted from the ranks, he
received the punishment he richly deserved. The girls were now
given in charge to a sergeant’s wife, and told they should be sent
with the next transport back to their father’s friend, the
commanding officer of the Egyptian troops on the borders, who would
then see them forwarded to their parents; but this good fortune was
not their fate. The sergeant, to whose care they were intrusted,
happened to meet a Djelabi one evening in a certain house, he waked
the girls out of their sleep at night, told them to prepare for
their journey home, and led them to the banks of the blue Nile,
where they were ferried across, and immediately mounted on a camel
standing in readiness to receive them. Early the next day they were
delivered over to a second slave-merchant, who sold them to a Turk
at Cairo, of whom the European, at whose house I met the elder
girl, had bought her. Thus we see, that a hard fate attends these
poor blacks everywhere, and that slavery, without the possibility
of escape, is almost their certain lot.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span><a id=
"c10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="med">RELIGION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> greater part of the natives of
Kordofan profess Islamism, but they are less fanatic than other
Mahommedans, probably arising from the fact, that few Christians
and no Jews are to be met with in these southern parts, hence there
is no cause for religious asperity or hatred. I found, however, as
a rule that, with the exception of the Dongolavi, but few adhere
strictly to the Koran, and their ideas on articles of faith are
quite in their infancy; nor do they trouble themselves much with
the various religious ceremonies, and live in a state of utter
ignorance, with the exception of believing in one God, and
sometimes calling upon their prophet for assistance. There are very
few Mosques in the country, and these are only frequented by the
Turks and Dongolavi, who are resident there. Thus the Koran is not
very strictly followed, but every one lives after that natural
species of religion which has been impressed upon his mind, through
the medium of his senses of sight, and hearing, under the paternal
roof. Hence all manner of heterogeneous opinions and ideas
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> mixed-up with
their faith. They believe in one God, and in addition to him in an
evil spirit, and a great deal of heathen superstition is, moreover,
jumbled together with their Islamism. A prominent cause of this
ignorance is the negligence of the government, which does not
institute a sufficient number of schools, for very few of them are
to be found among the majority of the tribes. Only a small portion
of the natives can read and write, with the exception of the
Fakeérs and Tekirs. It is the office of these men to study the
Koran, and to communicate what they have read to the people. The
former are the school-masters and religious instructers: they write
a few sentences from the Koran on a board, and make their scholars
copy them. When they have learnt thus much, they are considered
sufficiently instructed, leave the school, and before a year is
over have forgotten everything again. They also write amulets, with
which they frequently deceive the people in the most shameful
manner. They ingratiate themselves further into the favour of
families, like the clergy of Italy, and when they have once gained
a footing, worm out the most trivial secrets, interfere with all
the domestic affairs, and have frequently more authority in the
house than the master himself. Matches are concocted by them, and,
in fact, nothing is undertaken without their advice. The functions
of a Fakeér would appear to be hereditary, for they descend
generally from father to son, and are not so easily
transferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> from
one family to another. They also make vows, for example, not to
smoke for the remainder of their lives, to abstain from merissa and
coffee, each man choosing the hardship he likes best; in short,
they are the same as the Derweéshes among the Turks, but with this
wide difference, that they are looked upon as saints. I found the
greatest number of Fakeérs among the Dongolavi, who are also the
most rigid observers of the Mahommedan religion, with one single
exception, that they are very fond of brandy. They do not follow
agricultural pursuits, but are merchants, brokers, &amp;c. They are
said, as a rule, to be all capable of reading and writing, and wear
a long string of large wooden beads round their necks. The majority
of them are hypocrites, and indeed it is better to avoid them
altogether.</p>

<p>The Mahommedan negroes all live in a state of the most abject
ignorance. Not many Fakeérs are to be met with among them, and,
with the exception of circumcision, they bear in fact very few
signs of belonging to the Mahommedan religion. They have some
peculiar ideas of their own on matters of faith, for example, on
the creation of the world, and mix up a great deal of superstition
with the Koran, with which they are altogether but very little
acquainted. Thus an old negro explained to me why God Almighty
allowed white men, dark-coloured, and black men, to live together
in this world. When, namely, our first parents were driven out of
Paradise after committing the original<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_187">[187]</span> sin, the Lord came down from heaven every
day to see his orders strictly obeyed, and to convince himself that
they gained their daily bread with the sweat of their brow. Eve, or
as the negroes call our first mother, <em>Hauve</em>, bore daily
many hundred children, which she was obliged to shew to the
<em>Abou</em>, (God the Father) who sent them into all parts of the
world there to multiply. It happened once that <em>Hauve</em>
brought several hundred children into the world of a darker colour.
When <em>Abou</em> came and saw these, he reproached
<em>Hauve</em>, and said he would not have any more of these dark
babes, took them immediately away from her, and transplanted them
into the present Abyssinia. Shortly after this, <em>Hauve</em>
brought forth another lot of similar children, which for fear of
the <em>Abou</em>, she locked in an oven to secrete them; but
<em>Abou</em>, on his arrival, had a suspicion of what had
transpired, and as he did not receive a satisfactory answer from
<em>Hauve</em> respecting the last children, hunted for them
everywhere, and found them eventually in the oven. When they crept
out of their place of confinement, they were all quite black with
the soot. <em>Abou</em> in his wrath at this second offence on the
part of <em>Hauve</em>, again took away her children, and swore
that they should, in commemoration of their mother’s crime, remain
for ever as black as when they emerged from the oven, and that
nothing in the world should be capable of wiping off the stain.
These children now became the original parents of the negroes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>The Mahommedan
negroes are altogether fond of clothing their religion in a
traditionary garb, and of adulterating it with absurdities, which
remain then so strongly impressed upon their minds, that it is
almost impossible to eradicate the false notions and instruct them
differently. They believe firmly in metempsychosis, and accord to
apes the honour of being animated by those human souls which, for
the commission of some crime during life, must suffer punishment
after death in the shape of monkeys. They never in any way injure
these animals, and take care that they do not suffer from want of
food. If they see any person ill-treating one of them, they become
very wrath, and an old negro once reproached me severely for
punishing my monkey for some offence of which it had been guilty,
for, added he: “Why dost thou beat thy monkey? May it not be thy
grandfather, whose soul is incorporated in this animal after
death?” Elephants and parrots share the same honour with apes; and
they contend that the former more especially could not act so
sensibly as they do, unless a human soul dwelt within their
body.</p>

<p>Those sheikhs or saints, so common in Egypt, where they are
regarded as holy, and, as it were, adored, but who are virtually
idiots or cunning impostors, are not tolerated in Kordofan. On the
contrary, unfortunate beings really neglected by nature are not
indeed ill-treated, but kept as secluded as they possibly can be in
their own families,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
who take care that they do not so readily come in contact with
strangers. I only know of two instances in the whole province of
Kordofan of those saints above-mentioned (Sheikhs) being
worshipped, as they so frequently are, by the Moslems, both before
and after death. The one of these died several years ago, and the
people from the most distant parts, at the present time undertake
pilgrimages to his grave, situated at a distance of two hours’
march from Lobeid. They there make vows to do certain things if the
saint will grant them their request. The offerings brought to his
grave consist of sheep, corn, &amp;c.; the former are slaughtered
on Mondays and Thursdays, and distributed among the blind beggars
who assemble on these days, at the tomb. The person bringing the
sacrifice now offers up a short prayer, and thus the vow is
completed.</p>

<p>The second Sheikh, who is yet living at Lobeid, is named Beduy:
he is a pious man and anything but a hypocrite, hence he is beloved
and enjoys the good opinion of all men. He settles disputes, and
gives friendly advice to all who come to ask for it, knows no
partiality, and in no instance receives a present. He lives very
simply, his food consisting of nothing but <em>Garat</em>,<a id=
"FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
which he has ground to flour, and made into bread. He only eats
meat once a year. I have visited him on various occasions,
conversed with him on a variety of topics,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_190">[190]</span> and have had the opportunity of convincing
myself that he is possessed of good sound sense, and has correct
ideas on most subjects. As far as his religion is concerned, he is
a rigid Mahommedan, and defends his opinions and articles of faith
with the greatest zeal; but I never heard him speak with contempt
of the Christian or of any other religion, as the Derweeshes
frequently do; he merely pities those who are not as fortunate as
himself in belonging to the true faith. In short, he is a
Mahommedan missionary. He has made thousands of proselytes among
the heathen negroes, for he strolls about during the greater part
of the year in the mountains, endeavouring to disseminate el Islam.
He also defends his faith according to the letter of the Koran,
sword in hand, and has even lost a son in the fight for the good
cause. The Fakeérs are very much afraid of him, and take great care
not to play their pranks in his vicinity; he also feels a thorough
contempt for them.</p>

<p>It is high time for the Missionary Societies of Europe to direct
their attention to this part of Africa; if they delay much longer
it will be too late, for when the negroes have once adopted the
Koran, no power on earth can induce them to change their opinions.
I have heard through several authentic sources that there are but
few provinces in the interior of Africa where Mahommedanism has not
already begun to gain a footing. The Djelabi are the people who
have taken the conversion of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_191">[191]</span> the negroes on themselves, and have met
with partial success; I must, however, observe, that if the
propaganda, or protestant missionary societies, should decide upon
sending missionaries into the country, they ought not to settle
where the Koran predominates, for all their trouble would be
wasted, and all their money spent in vain. Sennaar and Kordofan,
are not fit provinces for this purpose, even if they intended to
convert negroes from distant countries, who may be there bought for
a trifle, and to send them back into their own country; for the
converse with Mahommedans, and the acquirement of the Arabic
language, would be sufficient causes of themselves to frustrate
their endeavours. Nuba, Kodero, Shilluk, Runga, Kulla, &amp;c.;
these are the countries where something might yet be done, but “if
it were done, when ’tis done, then ’twere well, it were done
quickly,” or these, and many other states, will be lost to
Christianity.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span><a id=
"c11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="med">DISEASES.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> all my travels I never met with any
country where the climate is so unhealthy, and where there is such
a variety of disease as in Kordofan. Every one in the province,
natives and strangers, more or less succumb to this scourge, but
the Europeans are the first who fall victims. Two thirds of the
white men who visit these regions may be with certainty regarded as
sacrificed. The Turks and Egyptians ordered there in Mehemed Ali’s
service, dwindle down perceptibly, and must be continually replaced
by fresh supplies. Of the sixteen European medical men and
apothecaries employed in Kordofan, within the space of seventeen
years seven have died, and of eight Englishmen sent into this
province to work iron mines, six perished in less than two months,
and the remaining two only escaped with their lives by making a
rapid flight from this unhealthy district. Captain Woodfall, an
Englishman, who visited this country in the year 1831, fell a
victim to the climate.</p>

<p>All diseases show themselves with redoubled vigour during the
rainy season; no house, no hovel<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_193">[193]</span> is then free from sick, and the whole of
Kordofan may be regarded as one large hospital. The total want of
European medical men who are only to be found attached to the army
at Lobeid—during my residence in this town, there were none at all
there, for the only one I met with very soon died—is a circumstance
deeply to be regretted; and it has generally happened that those
sent into the province have paid their tribute to the climate, or
were soon thus far disabled that they could be of no assistance to
other sufferers. There is, indeed, no lack of native doctors, but
it may be easily imagined to what system of treatment a patient is
subjected under their hands. Add to this the favourite, <em>“Allah
kerim”</em> (as God will) of the Mahommedans, and we may readily
understand the reason why they never resort to means for
suppressing a slight indisposition until it increases to a
frightful disease. Before parents offer their children relief in
sickness, or before the children attend to their parents, they
consult Fakéers and writers of amulets, and the like fanatics and
fortune-tellers, and their advice must have proved useless.</p>

<p>The chief diseases are fevers, dysentery, abscesses about the
neck (named <em>durore</em>), dropsy, small-pox, jiggers, skin
diseases, and lues. Every resident in the country is attacked with
fever, and all precautionary measures to avert the evil, such as a
regular life, etc., are generally speaking futile. I found, on the
contrary, that those persons who indulged in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_194">[194]</span> ardent liquors, such as brandy, merissa,
or bill-bill, remained far more free from fever and dysentery, than
those who endeavoured to escape these complaints by the observance
of rigid diet, and other prophylactic means; for the latter were
not only sooner attacked, but sooner fell victims to these
scourges. I myself observed this mode of life; but, unfortunately,
experienced the contrary to what I might have expected, under
similar circumstances, in Europe, or in any more healthy climate;
for, out of the eleven months of my residence in this country,
there were but few weeks during which I could consider myself free
from fever and dysentery. All the drugs, with which I had provided
myself for my journey, proved of no avail, until I followed the
advice of several old people, and drank brandy and merissa, in
moderation, when both diseases left me. The chief causes of the two
maladies named, are the sudden changes of temperature, and, more
especially, the use of water. The greater part of the water is
putrescent, much of it is filled with animalculæ, if it be not
previously boiled; and unfortunately for the adoption of this
precaution the opportunity is not always at hand; in this case it
should be mixed with brandy. Where these rules are not observed,
fever, or dysentery, are sure to be the infallible consequence.</p>

<p>The methods of treatment, customary among the natives of
Kordofan, are various, and consist in the employment of the common
domestic quack-remedies<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_195">[195]</span> of Europe, in addition to the
above-mentioned superstitious aids. Thus, those attacked with
fever, after the amulets and other mystic charms have proved
useless, drink, for three or four days, a cup containing about a
pound of melted butter daily, or a large quantity of milk, in which
sandal-wood has been steeped during twenty-four hours. Both these
remedies produce a powerful alterative effect, and I saw several
persons cured of fever by them. For allaying dysentery, they make
use of sour milk, in which <em>dabaldia</em>, the fruit of a tree,
causing constipation, has been steeped over night. The same fruit,
taken in small quantities, acts as a gentle purgative; but these
modes of treatment are only adapted to the natives, and always
prove fatal to Europeans. For dropsy they know of no remedy, and
persons attacked with this disease die, with but few
exceptions.</p>

<p>As soon as the jiggers show themselves, the part inflamed is
burnt with a red-hot iron, and a small opening made, when the worm
immediately presents itself. The treatment is now the same as that
of tapeworm: thus the natives seize the portion of the animal
protruding through the opening, wind it carefully round a small
piece of wood, and proceed in this manner until they have gradually
extracted the whole. If it tear before it is entirely eradicated,
the disease is reproduced. When attacked with small-pox, the
natives rub their whole body with earth, or roll in the sand, until
the pustules are broken, and the entire surface is covered with
an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> incrustation,
which they allow to remain adherent until the period of
desiccation. A negro, who has suffered from small-pox, presents a
very ridiculous appearance when the scabs fall off, for his body is
speckled with white spots, which gradually become red, but resume,
subsequently, the original black colour,—he is, in fact, for the
time being, pie-bald. They suffer greatly with this disease, for
they cannot keep themselves warm for want of clothing, or other
covering, and are thus put to inconceivable torture. A great number
of natives fall victims to this complaint, but the majority are
cured. The form of disease presenting itself with abscesses about
the neck, named durore, is indigenous to the country, and
frequently shews itself during the rainy season; it is said by the
natives to originate in colds. In the treatment of this affection,
they open the abscesses with the potential cautery, and when the
matter is discharged, dress the wound with an ointment prepared of
butter and clay. Syphilis was totally unknown in these regions
during the preceding century, and the natives have only been
inoculated within recent years, through the intermediation of the
Egyptian troops quartered in the province. It may be easily
imagined what ravages this disease commits, as these simple people,
unacquainted with its nature, frequently neglect it for a
considerable time. They are certainly at present rather more
enlightened on the subject, and resort to a few remedies, which,
however, prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> of
slight avail, and, during the rainy season more especially, all
endeavours to arrest its progress are in vain. The disorder assumes
a very obstinate character in this country; for though cured in the
dry season, it generally presents itself again at the period of the
rain,—a circumstance very easily explained, if we consider that the
cure, what with their inacquaintance with the nature of the
disease, and defective treatment, is generally palliative, or
temporary, and never radical; hence many of these patients remain
cripples for life. They mostly employ in the treatment an earth,
named traiba,<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a> which has a purgative action. The lavements are
administered in the following manner:—They take the thighbone of a
fowl, and clearing away the marrow, fasten it to a portion of the
intestines of a sheep, into which they pour a decoction of
garra,<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class=
"fnanchor">[51]</a> and then insert the pipe into the anus,
compressing the gut until the whole of the contents pass into the
abdomen. If to the want of medical men, and scarcity of remedies,
we add the state of uncleanliness in which these people live, we
may form some slight idea of the sufferings they endure in
sickness. It is, in fact, impossible to form a conception of the
misery to be met with in their hovels, which are sometimes crowded
with patients; nursing and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_198">[198]</span> all attention is out of the question; every
man is left to himself, hence many of course perish, who, with but
slight care, might easily have been saved, but—Allah Kerim!</p>

<p>There are no prophylactics against all these diseases, and I
know of no better advice to give to Europeans travelling in this
country than to caution them against drinking new milk or water;
the latter they should always boil, and ought moreover to be
careful to keep themselves, and more especially their feet, warm
during the rainy season; they should further use a large quantity
of pepper with their food, and rather eat too little than too much.
In cases of dysentery, for which rice and gum-water are generally
prescribed in Egypt, the traveller should by all means avoid these
same remedies, for he would only debilitate his digestive organs
the more. For my own part I resorted latterly to the shells of the
pomegranate steeped for a few hours in cold water, and found this
remedy very successful. It is quite a mistake to imagine the use of
spirituous liquors pernicious in tropical climates, for I convinced
myself, but unfortunately too late, of the contrary. On my own
personal experience I can assert that a moderate quantity of brandy
(in defect of wine) or Merissa taken daily is an excellent
prophylactic. All those natives, moreover, who possess the means of
procuring it, enjoy health, and are not so easily attacked with
fever or dysentery; it will of course be understood that every
excess is hurtful.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span><a id=
"c12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="med">THE TROOPS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> military force stationed in Kordofan
consists of three battalions of the first regiment of the line,
each battalion being composed of 1000 men, further of 800 Bedouin
horsemen, called also Mogghrebeen, and of about 40 artillery men to
serve the few guns employed in the slave-hunting expeditions; to
this number about 200 men of the irregular Turkish cavalry were
added, in the commencement of the year 1839. The latter troops were
removed from Dongola to Kordofan, but for an indefinite time only;
they were, indeed, expecting orders shortly to return to their
former quarters. The staff is stationed at Lobeid, and the colonel
of the regiment (the Bey) whom we have before mentioned, is both
civil and military governor of the province. Two companies of the
same regiment are quartered in Sennaar. This regiment was
originally the first which Mehemed Ali formed of Negroes at Assuan
in Egypt, and placed on European footing; hundreds of Egyptians
have, at various times, been drafted into this corps, but they
mostly fell victims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
to the climate, or perished after a few years’ service in the
razzias or slave-hunts. The entire garrison consists of blacks: it
is, in fact, indispensably necessary that it should be so; for the
white men cannot accommodate themselves to the climate. Among all
Mehemed Ali’s troops, numbers of which I have seen in various parts
of his dominions, I never met with a regiment so wretchedly
equipped, so badly drilled, and so utterly deficient in discipline
as the one in question. The soldiers wear only a white cotton
uniform, and it would be injudicious indeed to clad them in cloth
in this hot climate; but when we come to consider that the negroes,
by nature not over addicted to cleanliness, do not trouble
themselves with washing, and are not even provided for this purpose
with soap, an expense they feel no inclination to defray from their
own purses, and add to this that they are in the habit of anointing
their bodies frequently with butter as a means for preserving their
health, a pretty correct idea of a trooper of Kordofan may be
formed. On meeting one of these foot-soldiers without his
accoutrements a stranger is really at a loss how to classify him,
and before he has thoroughly accustomed himself to the sight he
would rather take him for a scarecrow than a soldier.<a id=
"FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
The accoutrements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
like the regimentals, are not in the very best state; while the
drill sergeants are as ignorant as the recruits, and quite
inadequate to their task, with the exception that the latter have
no conception of fire-arms; thus muskets may be seen on which Time
has set his tooth in the literal sense, so weak in the barrel, not
with over cleaning, but with over rust, that they would never stand
a charge. Instead of a flint a piece of wood is frequently screwed
into the lock, the soldier finding it far more judicious to sell
the former to enable him to buy a little tobacco. To prevent
desertion as far as it is possible, the government encourages the
soldiers in marrying; they do not then live in barrack, but in
separate huts of their own without the precincts. It must not,
however, be imagined that there are barracks in Kordofan like those
in Europe, or even in Egypt. Those at Lobeid consist of about fifty
detached huts built irregularly, but surrounded with a fence of
thorn; in the latter an aperture is left, guarded with the branch
of a tree, which forms the gate. The interior arrangements
correspond with the external appearance; beside the angarebs and
the knapsacks of the men, there is not a single article of barrack
furniture to be seen. There are three infantry barracks of this
description in Lobeid. When the men mount guard, the women
accompany them, or, if they happen to be unmarried, some of their
comrades follow, carrying the straw mats and pipes of the
detachment; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> it
is the first maxim among them to make their visit to the guard-room
as pleasant and comfortable as possible. This rule extends even to
the very sentry, who makes his duties as easy as he possibly can;
he does not stand sentry, but sits down whilst on duty, and that
the musket may not inconvenience him by its weight during this
important time, he lays it down at a few paces distance. If an
officer happen to pass by, the occurrence by no means disturbs his
equanimity; the sentinel at the most rises, but shouldering or
presenting arms is a mark of respect never heard of. In relieving
guard they do not wait for orders or other arrangements, but as
soon as the fresh detachment arrives, and the various posts have
been relieved, every man walks quietly home with his straw mat and
pipe under one arm, and his musket on the other, leaving it to his
superior officers to manage every thing else.</p>

<p>Their drill and exercise is at the same low ebb as their
garrison and field service. The recruits are drilled during a few
weeks only; they are quick of conception, and with the exception of
the Shilluks, very soon learn, but they as readily again forget
what they have acquired, for they do not consider it worth their
while to keep themselves in practice by repeated exercise. The
drill is generally performed singly, they very seldom exercise in
large detachments, and scarcely ever in companies. It is,
therefore, not astonishing, that a battalion<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_203">[203]</span> cannot execute the most simple movement
with precision. I have seen the commanding-officer on a field-day
not even able to bring his battalion to form a square; he had, in
fact, to take each separate man by the arm, and lead him to the
place where the square was to be formed, and yet this is the only
manœuvre to which they are obliged to pay attention, because
frequently put in practice in skirmishes, in warfare with their
neighbours, or on those barbarous expeditions of slave-hunting. The
intention of this <i>quarré</i> is to place the troops in readiness
to receive their enemy, who always attacks suddenly, sword in hand,
because it was found by experience that single detachments sent in
advance were literally cut up, notwithstanding the advantage
Mehemed Ali’s regular troops enjoy in the possession of fire-arms.
According to the present system, when an attack is expected, the
troops form a quarré, and prepare to receive cavalry; sometimes the
square is hollow, and all non-combatants, ammunition, and baggage,
and frequently also the cavalry, are enclosed within its precincts.
When the first shock has been sustained, and the enemy retreats in
disorder, they deploy and pursue. The nature of the attack of the
negroes has therefore induced the officers to have this manœuvre
principally practised. Of other movements, such as advancing in
column, marching in sections, wheeling to the right or left,
forming detachments, defiling, or other necessary manœuvres, be
they ever so simple, these soldiers<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204">[204]</span> have no conception, and should it ever
enter the head of the inspector at a review to order one of them,
it is executed with so much confusion, that the officer commanding
has the greatest trouble in re-forming his battalion from the
confused chaos. It is incredible how soon they forget every thing,
for this regiment formerly had an excellent French preceptor, as
lately even as the middle of the year 1837, at which period he was
obliged to leave the country on account of ill health. The troops
learn to shoot well; it is not, however, to be wondered at,
considering the wretched state of their muskets, if the best shot
frequently miss his aim. Ball practice, so essential a branch of
service, is but rarely resorted to, and in this country, indeed,
the soldier is treated more like a policeman than a military man,
for his services are required for enforcing the payment of taxes,
the arrest of prisoners, and for other duties generally devolving
upon the constabulary.</p>

<p>It would, moreover, prove a very dangerous experiment to trouble
the troops much with exercising and other matters of duty, and
would be attended with an incurrence of the very worst of hazards.
An officer dare not even venture to enforce his orders with the
common rigidity of discipline; they would not only not be obeyed,
but the officer offending in this manner must expect the worst.
With kindness every thing may be effected with these
semi-barbarians, whilst with harshness nothing is to be done; and
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> obtain obedience
to an order in which their services are required, it is necessary
either to rouse their ambition, or to persuade them by soft words.
There is, therefore, a wide difference between these negro soldiers
and the Egyptian troops. The latter, accustomed from infancy to be
driven with a stick to their duties, cringe before an officer, like
a worm upon the ground, in presentiment of the punishment they are
to undergo; whereas the negro who has been reared in liberty boldly
faces his superior, whilst awaiting his command. When he has
received his orders, provided his sense of dignity or freedom be
not impeached, the officer may rely upon their being punctually
executed. But woe betide the <i>martinet</i> who should venture to
force a soldier by harsh words or ill-treatment to the performance
of his duty! His life would be endangered from that moment, and a
revolt amongst the whole troops might prove of the most serious
consequence, as has already been the case. The Turkish officers are
well aware of this, and are very careful not to say or do anything
that might irritate the negro soldiers.</p>

<p>The pay is the same as that of all other Egyptian troops,
namely, twenty paras (two-pence) per diem, and a ration consisting
of bread, meat, and butter in abundance; but for their actual pay
they have to wait frequently a whole twelvemonth, and their arrears
are then liquidated with slaves or camels.</p>

<p>It frequently happens on these occasions that a son receives his
father or his brother instead of payment.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_206">[206]</span> It might be imagined that this would be
considered a fortunate occurrence by both parties, and that the
slave would, as a natural consequence, be liberated; but this is by
no means the case, for the soldier has usually incurred a debt on
his arrears, and in the distribution of pay two troopers very often
become co-proprietors of one full-grown slave. Thus little regard
can be paid to filial or fraternal affection; the soldier can only
delay the sale of his father or brother for a few days, but it must
eventually take place. Officers themselves have told me, that these
scenes are of frequent occurrence, and that it would move the heart
of the most unfeeling man to pity, to behold a son or brother
concluding the bargain with the Djelabi for his near relative, when
they are forced to part for ever.</p>

<p>The soldiers’ boys receive pay from the day of their birth, and
having attained their eleventh year, are drafted into the ranks as
drummers or pipers; when they subsequently increase in strength
they advance to the musket. On the whole, a military anarchy may be
almost said to reign predominant; and it is indeed an arduous
undertaking for the colonel to keep order among these undisciplined
troops. Their present commander, however, appears to be better
fitted to the task, and also to have the design of paying greater
attention to the subject; for he insists upon a more rigid
discipline, but will tolerate no ill-treatment; and I am convinced
that he is most likely to succeed in bringing about an<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> improved subordination, as
everything may be expected from the negroes by stimulating their
ambition.</p>

<p>The Bedouins, those children of the desert, enticed by vain
promises from their native plains, to them still dear, though
neglected by nature, are to be pitied indeed; for they have but
slight hopes of ever being able to return to their homes; receive a
miserable pay after waiting for it for a long time, like the rest
of the troops; and are expected to find themselves in clothing,
horses, and accoutrements out of their own pockets. Their sheikh
must supply all deficiencies, and if a man lose his horse is forced
to procure him another, whilst the Bedouin has to resign all claims
on pay, until the sum the new animal cost is defrayed; and thus it
often happens that the poor fellow must serve during three or five
years gratuitously. The government allows no compensation, even if
the horse be killed on actual service. It will now be understood
what kind of services may be expected from these men. Although they
are not deficient in personal valour, in cases where it is
required, and are certainly equal to the rest of the troops in
courage and bravery, if they do not surpass them; yet they never
confidently meet the enemy, as a natural consequence of this absurd
system, for they are always thinking of their horses, on these
occasions, and often take to flight at the most decisive moment, to
avoid sustaining a loss. It has frequently even happened on
slave-hunts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> in
which service they are generally employed, that the van-guard, on
being surprised by the enemy, has turned to the right about in
disorderly flight, and thrown the infantry, by which it was to be
supported, into confusion; so that the latter were obliged to
retreat in all haste, and to form again, in order to stand the
charge of the pursuing enemy. If the government were to treat the
Mogghrebeen like the rest of the cavalry, and when they had lost a
horse in service, were to provide them with another, or at least to
allow some proper indemnification, they would prove a far more
efficient body of men. This corps is, moreover, not treated as it
deserves; for if one of them happen to be on the sick list he is
not even admitted into the infirmary. Certainly, as far as my
experience bears me out, they are far better off in this respect
than those who have the misfortune to be received into the hospital
at Lobeid, whilst under the direction of medical men who have
pursued the whole course of their studies from beginning to end at
Abusabel.<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class=
"fnanchor">[53]</a> There is more discontent among these Bedouins
or Mogghrebeen, as they are also termed, (although they constitute
the less number of the body,) than in any other corps. The greater
part of them are quartered at Lobeid, the rest are distributed over
the country, where they perform a species of gens d’armes duty. The
circumstance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
their being used by the government as catchpolls, and the excess of
which they are frequently guilty in their ill-humour and
discontent, render them obnoxious to the natives, and they
themselves take no pains to heal the breach or to remove this ill
impression. They are of robust constitution, and can defy the
climate and all weather. An instance presenting the opportunity of
convincing myself of their capability of bearing more than ordinary
men came under my own observation. It appears, indeed, an adventure
<em>á la Münchhausen</em>, but I can vouch for the truth, for I was
not the only person present at the time, but several thousands
witnessed the feat:—The governor held a review of all the troops
prior to a march, the occasion was a slave-hunt. After inspecting
the Mogghrebeen, he commanded them to dismount; in the confusion
attending this movement, a horse broke loose and ran away. Some of
the men pursued it on horseback, whilst others endeavoured to catch
it on foot: and thus it happened that a Bedouin who tried to stop
the animal came in collision with it, his forehead, indeed,
striking the front of the horse. Both man and beast instantly fell,
the horse dead on the spot, but the man survived the shock for
several days.</p>

<p>Their arms consist of a long gun, two pistols, and a sabre;
their colours are a green silk flag, which they regard as sacred,
and two kettle-drums attached to the saddle-bow of the drummers
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> beaten on a
march by way of music, which is, of course, very monotonous. These
troops are irregulars, and their attacks are always made with
impetuosity, and in the greatest disorder. Hence the first moment
is decisive, whether they shall keep the ground, or seek their
safety in a precipitate flight.</p>

<p>The third detachment of troops, stationed in Kordofan, consists
of about forty men of artillery. I have been present at their ball
practice, and have, therefore, had the opportunity of convincing
myself of their performances. Of fifty balls scarcely one hit the
target, and even the successful shot must be ascribed to perfect
chance, for the men have not the slightest conception of charging
or pointing their guns. The pieces of ordnance are in a most
lamentable condition; the carriages, warped by the excessive heat,
give no firmness to their bearings, and the officers and men have
no idea of remedying the defect. Repair is totally out of the
question, and thus these field-pieces are dragged about from place
to place, as long as it is possible, when their services are
required, charged, pointed at hazard at the object against which
they are employed, and fired without further consideration. The
effect of their balls may be easily guessed; during the first
slave-hunts, when they attacked a hill, several shots were
generally fired at an object without one ball ever taking effect.
The negroes were, indeed, alarmed at the terrible report, and even
put to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> rout;
but they soon became accustomed to the noise, and, subsequently,
paid but little attention to it, when they perceived no other
effect than noise and smoke. The artillery men are all Turks, and
when they are enlisted at Cairo no one questions what their prior
occupation consisted in; it is, in fact, all the same whether they
were shoemakers or tailors by trade, they are enrolled as
artillery, and must, henceforth, act in that capacity.</p>

<p>The military, in general, have a great deal to suffer, for,
besides being hated by the people, as the executioners of the cruel
punishments to which the poor natives are frequently condemned by
the government, they do not lead the most agreeable life
themselves, inasmuch as they are only paid once a-year. They are
obliged to serve for the term of their natural lives, and are
nothing but slaves in the strictest sense of the word. If a man
fall sick, he is, indeed, admitted into the hospital, but this is a
perfect place of horror to the soldier, for, as soon as he enters
the infirmary, he may make his will and prepare for his latter end,
so few are fortunate enough to escape with their lives. It would
really be more humane to allow the soldiers to cure themselves
after their own fashion; and I am convinced that the majority of
those literally murdered by the doctors and apothecaries from sheer
ignorance, would be yet living to put them to the blush. Before I
was aware of the frightful mortality in the hospitals, I expressed
my sorrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> for the
poor Mogghrebeen who are refused admission, and severely censured
the government for its cruelty; but I subsequently convinced myself
that they have every reason to think themselves fortunate in not
being received into those houses of slaughter. I procured, indeed,
the bills of mortality of the regiment, and that of the corps of
Mogghrebeen, compared the number of deaths amongst the three
thousand troops of the line and the number of patients in the
hospital, with those of the eight hundred men, Bedouins, who
receive no medical relief, but cure themselves by domestic
remedies, and found a result of twenty-seven per cent. of deaths
among those killed in the hospital above the rate of mortality of
the Mogghrebeen, who are left entirely to themselves. The Egyptian
doctors and apothecaries, scarcely escaped from the elementary
schools and placed on their own footing, treat the sick soldiers
like cattle, never dream of diagnosis, prescribe whatever enters
their heads, and care very little whether they save a man’s life or
murder him.</p>

<p>The hospital consists of a few hovels of clay, covered with a
straw roofing; they are ill-ventilated, and, in the wet season, the
rain beats in upon the sick soldiers through the narrow windows, as
they are not furnished with glass; the cold nights, moreover, prove
very severe trials, especially to those who are suffering from
small-pox. The invalid lies on an angareb, and is left to
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> fate. The
medical man hurries through the whole hospital in one single visit,
which he pays after sunrise, prescribes what he has been reading up
for the occasion at home, without inquiring into the disease, and
every order is given on the principle of “Allah kerim!” I have
several times had the opportunity of convincing myself of the
unparalleled neglect with which the hospital patients are treated,
for, on my arrival at Lobeid, I found but one European medical man,
Dr. Iken, a native of Hanover, who was too ill to do duty, and
shortly afterwards died. It is a common saying, that an apothecary
is no physician, and, <i>vice versâ</i>; but we know by experience
that there are many apothecaries who are sufficiently well educated
to be able to prescribe a remedy in cases of urgent necessity; we
may, however, form an idea of the want of medical knowledge of an
Arabian apothecary, when the doctor of medicine is himself
ignorant, and we may also guess what the poor patients who fall
into their hands have to expect or suffer between them. In Europe,
the sick soldier is desirous of being admitted into the hospital,
because he is convinced that he will there receive speedy and
certain relief. In Lobeid, the contrary is observed, for the
invalided men are obliged to be dragged to the infirmary by force,
because they stand in so much awe of this terrible place, that
every disease increases as soon as they know that they<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> are to enter the
establishment; and thus the greater number keep their sufferings
secret as long as they possibly can. The apothecary who performed
the duty of the medical man in the infirmary paid his visit once
daily, and, on his arrival there, it depended, properly speaking,
on the nurses what medicines the patients should take. Of these
subordinate functionaries, even, there was a great deficiency, for,
as fast as they arrived from Cairo, they were taken off their
duties and employed by the doctor and apothecary in private
practice; for by these means they were enabled to earn more than
their pay, for which they always had to wait twelve months. This
extensive apothecary, who acted in the capacity of pharmaceutist
and medical man, usually commenced a categorical conversation with
the nurse, without seeing any one of the patients; the following
dialogue took place during one of my visits to the
establishment.</p>

<p><em>Apothecary.</em>—“How is No. 1?”</p>

<p><em>Nurse.</em>—“He is still feverish.”</p>

<p><em>Apoth.</em>—“It cannot be helped, for I have not had a
drachm of quinine for several months past, and I have no other
febrifuge; he will get better in time without physic. How is No.
2?”</p>

<p><em>Nurse.</em>—“He died last night.”</p>

<p><em>Apoth.</em>—“And is No. 3 no better?”</p>

<p><em>Nurse.</em>—“He wants nothing further, for in two or three
days he will be dead.”</p>

<p><em>Apoth.</em>—“How is No. 7?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_215">[215]</span><em>Nurse.</em>—“I don’t understand his
complaint. The patients tell me he has not been able to sleep for
the last four nights; he has no appetite, and is continually
vomiting.”</p>

<p><em>Apoth.</em>—<em>(Making up some tincture of opium, which he
gives to the nurse.)</em> “There, that is to make him sleep. I know
nothing about the other symptoms. What does No. 8 say for himself?
has his dysentery diminished?”</p>

<p><em>Nurse.</em>—“No, it has rather increased, and it will
probably be all over with him this evening, so he wants nothing
more; but No. 9 may be discharged to-day.”</p>

<p><em>Apoth.</em>—“How is No. 35?”</p>

<p><em>Nurse.</em>—“I think he ought to be bled, for the
inflammation increases.”</p>

<p><em>Apoth.</em>—“I will have nothing at all to do with
venesection, for I might be placed in the same unpleasant position
as Dr. Ali Effendi, from whose pay three hundred piasters were
deducted, because he divided the artery in performing the
operation, and the soldier was invalided. Is there no
increase?”</p>

<p><em>Nurse.</em>—“Three patients; two fevers, and I don’t know
what is the matter with the third, but my comrades think it is
gout.”</p>

<p>From this short dialogue, we may conclude how the hospital at
Lobeid is managed, and what condition the poor patients who are
sighing for relief must be in. No medicine, no attention, and
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> hard couch! My
heart misgave me every time I entered this place of misery, and saw
the cool deliberation with which the poor sick soldiers are
murdered, in the strictest sense of the word. If the other
inhabitants of Lobeid died in the same ratio, the capital of
Kordofan would be totally depopulated in less than fifty years.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span><a id=
"c13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
<span class="med">PRODUCTS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> two seasons prevailing in this
country and so strongly defined, are the chief reason why the
ground does not yield as many products as might be obtained by the
assistance of art; for, if field and garden fruits were cultivated
with the utmost care during the dry season, no success could be
expected, as there is a total want of water wherewith to irrigate
the plants, and, in the wet season, the rain beats down with such
force that it would wash all small plants out of the earth; hence
agriculture is confined to articles which thrive without much
attention, and proceed quickly to maturity. I have no doubt that,
if wells were sunk and large reservoirs excavated to collect,
during the rainy months, the quantity of water necessary for the
irrigation of the soil during the ensuing dry season, many
vegetables might be produced which it is now quite impossible to
rear. There are no running streams, and the few small lakes, or
rather ponds, met with in the country, are not supplied with water
throughout the year, and are,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_218">[218]</span> moreover, very inconsiderable when compared
with the extent of arable land.</p>

<p>Horticulture is limited to certain spots, and, excepting at Bara
and some other small villages, where there is plenty of water, no
gardens are to be seen in the whole province. The wants of the
natives who live in fixed places of residence are not such as they
may supply by cultivating gardens; and the frequent change of
residence is a yet greater hindrance to the nomades from occupying
themselves with tillage of the ground. The blame, however, is
chiefly to be attributed to the government, who would lay their
hands upon the harvest, or levy large contributions upon it, which
the natives would not be able to pay. When the Egyptians first took
possession of the country, under the Defturdar, they found merely
dokn, a little douhra, water-melons, bamíyeh, meluchia (lentils),
onions, and tobacco. The Defturdar’s army, therefore, suffered
greatly from want of provisions, until it was supplied from the
stores in the north, and the necessary articles of consumption were
subsequently produced in the country. Since these times, the Turks,
who have become residents, and the Dongolavi have cultivated
gardens, in which they now grow wheat, bedingajoti<a id=
"FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
(Poradies-üepfel<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a>), small beans, radishes, celery, dill,
and garlic; some vineyards have been planted, as also
pomegranates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> lemon
trees, Indian and common figs. In the larger plantations sim-sim,
ful-Darfûr (beans from Darfour), rice, and cotton are grown. It is,
however, by mere chance if garden fruits, or green vegetables, are
ever seen exposed for sale in the market place at Lobeid; weeks
frequently pass without any such luxuries coming to sight, for the
gardeners are very far backward in their art, and take but little
pains to produce any plants. The natives, in fact, leave the
cultivation of the gardens, like everything else, to chance, and do
not give the vegetation the slightest assistance, so that it is
really by mere hazard if anything thrive. Should the traveller wish
to obtain vegetables for his own consumption during his residence
in this country, he must make a kind of agreement with the
proprietor of a garden to deliver the produce of the season at his
house; for to wait for what might be exhibited in the market, would
be, indeed, to wait in vain, as such an exhibition is, in the first
place, according to my former statement, of very rare occurrence,
and vegetables are only offered publicly for sale when all the
private consumers are supplied, and there is a surplus of one or
the other production. The vegetables indigenous in temperate
climates are not of the same succulent quality in this country,
partly because they are not properly attended to, and partly
because the tropical climate causes them to grow too luxuriantly to
arrive at the same state of perfection in which we obtain them in
Europe. Grapes ripen twice<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_220">[220]</span> in the year, but the leaves must be
gathered off the vines, or all the sap will be exhausted by the
foliage and tendrils, and no grapes will be formed. Those which
ripen in the month of August are very watery, those, on the other
hand, which come to perfection at the end of December are very
sweet. A great number of lime-trees are planted in the gardens, but
the lemons are too small, have but little juice and acidity, and
are quite exsiccated in a few days after they have been gathered
from the trees. The orange tree produces no fruit, for it is not
suited to the climate. Indian (cactus) and Syrian figs bear fruit,
but not of the best quality. The same observation applies to other
garden productions: they have not the flavour that might be
expected, and do not in general attain their full size, for all
plants form too much leaf to produce sound and good fruit. Thus
even onions are too sweet in taste, of small dimension, and without
the slightest acridity. Salad is not to be met with. The
water-melons, which are chiefly cultivated in Dar-Hammer, are not
of an agreeable flavour. The fruit of the few date-trees to be seen
in the province ripens during the rainy season, is, consequently,
very watery, and will not keep for any time, like the dates of
Egypt, but decomposes shortly after it is gathered. Sim-Sim is
largely cultivated, whence the natives express an oil used in the
preparation of their pomatum; for they never burn oil, and, if they
wish to illuminate their tukkoli at night-time, light a wood-fire.
Wheat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> is grown in
some few places, but only in small quantities, and in the dry
season, indeed, by artificial irrigation; a sufficient supply for
the few Turkish residents during a few months is, however, merely,
produced, and even they are obliged to eat dokn-bread during the
greater part of the year. This description of corn is very dear,
and cost, in the year 1838, two hundred piasters (£2 18<em>s.</em>
4<em>d.</em>) the ardeb; whilst in Egypt the value of the same
quantity rarely exceeds the sum of thirty or sixty piasters. Only
the Bakkara cultivate rice on the borders of the lakes Arrat and
Pirget, but it differs totally from the variety generally met with
in commerce; for it is small in grain, and of unpleasant flavour.
The greater quantity of rice consumed in Kordofan, by the Turks
more especially, is imported, therefore, from Egypt. Cotton is
grown in very inconsiderable quantities, in proportion to the
demand for this article; in fact, not one-third of the quantity
consumed in the manufacture of their calicoes. It is of the finest
quality, and resembles that of Sennaar,<a id=
"FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
well-known in the trade in Europe. The fibre is rather longer than
that of the Makko<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a> variety. I have often enquired of the
natives, why they do not attach more importance to the cultivation
of plants, which would prove of so much advantage to them, since
they are at present necessitated to purchase the calico required
for their simple clothing at a very high price; but they always
answered me, they were<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_222">[222]</span> well aware that the growth of cotton was
very profitable, but they had no desire to work for the soldiers of
the government, as they knew very well that they would leave them
little or none of the cotton produced, and they should therefore be
obliged to buy the cloth for their own consumption as they do at
present; hence they save themselves the labour. Indigo would thrive
very well in various parts of Kordofan,—for it grows spontaneously
in some districts,—and its cultivation would prove a source of
great profit to the government. Experiments have been already made,
and have furnished indigo of a quality superior to that of Egypt;
but the government pays no attention to this subject, and the
natives are far too ignorant to stumble upon an object of so much
importance without a hint from some kind friend.</p>

<p>All the articles above mentioned are reared in gardens, the
cultivation of which is entrusted to slaves. The irrigation is
effected artificially by means of draw-wells. As soon as the rainy
season is at an end, every native hastens to put his garden in
order, which during the former period had been, as it were, lying
fallow; for if any one were to venture to sow or plant during the
period of the rains, he must expect everything either to be washed
out of the earth by the violent showers, or to rot before it
arrived at maturity. Very few articles are, therefore, cultivated,
and these merely where the position of the land is suitable. The
absolute tillage, or treatment of the soil, requires<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> but slight trouble, for the
clods of earth are simply broken by means of a short-pointed stick,
beaten into mould with a rather thicker staff, and then levelled
with the hand, or with the same instrument. The seed is now sown,
and covered with a little earth; and small furrows are made in the
various beds, which are daily watered from a draw-well.
Agriculture, in general, is confined to dockn, a species of
field-fruit which may be compared to the millet, from which it
however differs in the circumstance that the stalk, with the
inflorescence, attains the height of seven or eight feet. It is the
only species of grain used by the inhabitants of Kordofan and the
bordering countries, and is indispensable to them for their bread.
It is a very exuberant and profitable plant, and is cultivated
everywhere throughout the whole province. The fields in which the
dockn grows are generally very large, and many of them are situated
in the forests. To render these woodland tracts arable, the trees
are hewn down to the height of a man; by the next year they are
dry—when fires are lighted, the stems being burnt at the same time
with the brushwood. These fields do not require as much labour and
attention as our corn-fields. The natives are not acquainted with
the plough, the harrow, or, in fact, with any other civilized
engine of husbandry; a single falciform piece of iron, pointed at
either extremity, and furnished in the centre with a staff, answers
the purpose of all necessary implements. This instrument is called
a hashash, and is to be found in every hut;<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_224">[224]</span> thus all the agricultural utensils of a
Kordofanese peasant cost twenty paras (little more than
three-halfpence). After the fall of the first rain the grass is
raked up in the fields, and preparations are made for sowing, an
occupation requiring the services of two persons only; the one
walks before the other, making, at about every two paces, a hole
with the hashash in the sandy soil, in which his companion each
time places a few seeds, and then treads down the hole with his
right foot. This operation is performed with extraordinary
rapidity. The ensuing rain imparts to the ground the necessary
moisture, and as soon as the rainy season terminates the fruit
ripens. The chief condition for a successful harvest is, that an
over abundance of rain do not injure the seed, and on this account
the field should be situated on a declivity, that the water may run
off; but if too little rain fall, a failure is likewise the result.
With the straw the natives build their tukkoli; the remainder is
consumed as food by the cattle. The grain is thrashed out in the
field, laden upon camels or oxen, and brought into the village,
where it is shot into pits lined with straw mats, and subsequently
covered over with sand. The latter proceeding is chiefly for the
purpose of securing the produce from the over-abundant vermin, and
frequently also from the rapacity of the government.</p>

<p>Besides this species of grain a small quantity of douhra may be
met with, and I doubt very much<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_225">[225]</span> whether a species of corn of the temperate
zone might be cultivated with more profit or with the same facility
as the dockn. It happens, however, in some years that the necessary
quantity is not grown, and then whole villages are frequently
necessitated to betake themselves to the woods, and live upon the
egelit,<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class=
"fnanchor">[58]</a> a fruit of the size of a plum, of a yellowish
colour, and pulpy consistence, which has not an unpleasant flavour.
Kordofan is altogether blest with many useful trees notwithstanding
its poverty in other respects, and an addition might be made to
their number with very little artificial aid, were the inhabitants
not too lazy and too stolid to engage with energy in any
undertaking, whilst the government, on the other hand, only directs
its attention to those objects which return an immediate
profit.</p>

<p>Among the most useful trees growing without cultivation, must be
reckoned: the gum-tree, the tamarind, the beautiful tabaldi, and
the egelit before mentioned. The gum-tree (<i>mimosa Nilotica</i>)
as it is termed in books, merits a different denomination in
Kordofan, for the shape of the tree, its leaves and spines, differ
materially from those of the mimosa Nilotica, properly so called.
The latter tree yields common gum only, whereas that of Kordofan is
of the finest description, so that it is erroneously distinguished
by the name of gum-Arabic.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_226">[226]</span> In some parts of the country, the mimosa
forms whole forests of vast extent; but the district of Bara
furnishes the largest quantity of gum. The harvest is modified by
the annual fall of rain, for, if it rain much, the trees sweat the
more. The gum exudes from the bark of the stem and large branches,
nearly in the same manner as the resinous exudation from the
cherry-trees of Europe. In digging for a beetle, I casually
observed that the gum proceeds from the root also. Sennaar, which
is situated under the same degree of latitude as Kordofan, yields a
far less quantity of this product. The gathering takes place a few
months after the rain, in the months of December, January, and
February, it is an exceedingly profitable affair to the government,
and therefore a monopoly. But even in this undertaking, the
Egyptians act with unparalleled neglect, and do not interfere when
they see whole forests of gum-trees hewn down, and the ground
converted into dockn fields, although immense tracts of the country
far better adapted for arable land remain uncultivated, by making
use of which, the gum-trees would be spared. But the government
does not trouble itself about such trifles, it merely scrapes
together that which comes within its reach without paying the
slightest attention to ulterior consequences. Of the plantation of
young trees and the extirpation of such as are unprofitable, it has
no idea, nature must attend to that business.</p>

<p>The Garrat,<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class=
"fnanchor">[59]</a> whose pod is employed in tanning,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> and the tamarisk
(<i>tamarindus Indica</i>) are likewise frequently seen in the
province, but not in the same abundance as the gum-tree. The pods
of the tamarind are collected and trodden into the form of cakes,
which are dried, and either kept for domestic use or converted into
commodity. A large quantity of this production is consumed in the
country. This tree suffers greatly by the locusts; for sometimes
the inflorescence, sometimes the fruit, is totally devoured by
these destructive insects, and in those years, there is, of course,
a scarcity of this fruit in many villages.</p>

<p>The Tabaldi is one of the most beautiful specimens of the
vegetable kingdom indigenous in this country. When in blossom, the
majestic tree is nearly covered with flowers, resembling those of
the double red hollyhock, and, at a distance, gives the idea of
hills covered with roses, while the eye rests with delight on so
beautiful an object. It blooms at the commencement of August: the
sarcocarp is three-quarters of a foot in length, interiorly divided
into many cells, each of which includes a stone. The fruit is of a
pleasing acidulous flavour, but causes diarrhoea in those who are
not accustomed to eat it; it is, however, also employed for
allaying dysentery; but, to produce this opposite effect, it must
be eaten in large quantities. The stems of these trees measure
sometimes more than forty feet in circumference, and the wood is as
hard as ebony; their age may be estimated at thousands of years.
Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> the fruit of the
Doum palm<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class=
"fnanchor">[60]</a> and fan-shaped palm,<a id=
"FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
the outer skin is eaten, and a kind of syrup is also obtained from
them.</p>

<p>Besides the trees above-mentioned, there is an innumerable
variety of plants which spring up from the ground in full
luxuriance after the first rain, and convert the whole province
into a most beautiful flower-garden. I am too little versed in
botany to be expected to give a full description of all the plants
found in the country, more especially as there are many species not
yet mentioned in any botanical work; but I am convinced that
Kordofan would prove a very interesting field to any botanist who
would take the trouble to explore it by travelling there for a
lengthened period. Dr. Rueppell and Mr. Kotschy spent too short a
time in the country, and visited, moreover, too few places to be
able to make valuable collections.</p>

<p>The animal kingdom affords a no less fertile source of
instruction and amusement in this country. Among domestic animals
we have the horse, the camel, the ass, the mule, the cow, the
sheep, the goat, the dog, the cat, fowls and pigeons; and of wild
beasts: lions, giraffes, leopards, panthers, two varieties of
hyænas, jackals, about ten species of antelopes, some of which are
not yet known in Europe: further, monkeys, three varieties of wild
cats, hares, hedge-hogs, black and yellow mice, rats,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> many animals
yet unknown, are to be met with in Kordofan; elephants and
rhinoceroses are rare; occasionally, however, one or the other of
these animals may be seen on the borders of the country. The
province is very rich in specimens of reptiles, and the boa may
also be found.</p>

<p>The country abounds in insects of every description, many of
which are analogous, or very similar, to those of Senegal. A good
harvest may be made a month before the rain, during the whole of
that season, and at the most a month after it; during the remainder
of the year all trouble to find single specimens even is in vain.
Collecting insects formed one of my chief occupations during the
whole of my travels, and my labours were rewarded in a very
extensive display of the various specimens of the insects of
Kordofan: so complete a collection was, in fact, never yet brought
from that country to Europe. Entomology might have been benefited
by the addition of many new species, and years must transpire
before so copious a collection will again reach Europe, for few men
will be able to stand eleven months of this unhealthy climate. I
have shed millions of drops of sweat in my pursuit, and looked like
one who had been scourged after every excursion, from the scratches
I received from the thorns, with which most of the shrubs and trees
of this country are furnished. I defied all weather and every
species of danger in forming this cabinet: but, unfortunately, all
my trouble, together with the advantages entomology<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> might thence have reaped, are
totally lost—thanks to those barbarians of the lazaretto at
Trieste, who allowed my whole collection, consisting of several
consignments, to spoil. In butterflies the country is very poor,
but there are more than a hundred different species of flies.</p>

<p>Among the feathered tribe there are birds of the most beautiful
plumage in this province, and many European varieties, even those
of Germany, hibernate here. The grey water-wagtail may more
especially be met with in myriads. The desert, the woods, even the
huts in the villages, are filled with these beautiful creatures,
which delight the eye with their magnificent colours, and the ear
with their charming song. It is, indeed, impossible to form a
conception of the spectacle they afford without having seen it. New
species arrive with every month, whilst others migrate until the
proper season recalls them. Eagles, vultures, parrots, colibris, a
variety of aquatic birds, ostriches, black storks, and the ibis,
considered holy by the ancient Egyptians, are to be here met with;
the latter two varieties are the chief birds of Kordofan. A large
aquatic bird saved me a great deal of trouble in collecting shells
in the marshes. If I descried one of these birds in the vicinity of
a pond, I had only to retreat to a distance of about fifty paces
from it, and to watch its movements. It dived beneath the water,
and always brought up one of the conchylia in its beak, which
resembles that of the woodpecker,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_231">[231]</span> and laid it on the sand at a distance of a
few paces from the water. Its prize consisted of a larger or
smaller number of these shells according to their size. It
generally collected about twelve on one spot, but as these
conchylia are bivalvular, and the one shell is so firmly connected
with the other that they can only be opened with a knife, it had to
wait until the rays of the sun performed the office for it. He
continually walked round the spot where he had deposed his prey,
and kept his eye upon it. As soon, however, as one of these
mollusca opened its shell he instantly inserted his beak, to
prevent it from closing it again, and tore it asunder with his
claw. I never disturbed him in his work, for he saved me the
trouble of destroying the animal and clearing the shell, which, as
I knew by experience, he seldom entirely separates.</p>

<p>Kordofan can enumerate no running streams; the fula (ponds) and
small lakes nearly all dry up during the hot season, and yet fish,
differing in variety and size, are to be found in this province. At
first, I could not understand this apparent anomaly, and the
explanation given me by the natives, that the fish hide themselves
in the mud, appeared to me very unsatisfactory, for it becomes in
time, so hard that a heavily laden waggon might pass over it, and
the spawn of the fish remaining would, of course, be soon destroyed
by the rays of the sun. The natives, however, firmly believe that
the fish are preserved under ground, and come to life again in
three or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> six
months’ time, when the rain has softened their bed. I, of course,
could not give credence to this version of the story, but casually
made a discovery likely to throw a light upon the subject. I one
day shot a wild duck, and having gutted it, proceeded to prepare it
for dinner; in examining the intestines, I found a quantity of fish
eggs. Is it not, therefore, probable that the aquatic birds, which
set out on their migration immediately after having gorged
themselves with spawn on the White Nile, and take to the water
again on their arrival in Kordofan, discharge one half of their
prey in an undigested form, and that thus the fish are shortly
hatched?</p>

<p>The horses are not very excellent, or of pure Arabian blood, but
a half-breed between Dongola horses and those of Berber and Darfûr;
they are not, indeed, as well built as the pure Arabians, but are,
nevertheless, fleet, and exceedingly hardy. The natives, more
especially the Bakkari, pride themselves on their steeds, and give
them milk to drink as long as they live, which they say renders
them very strong, and capable of enduring the greatest fatigue. The
other inhabitants of Kordofan also offer their horses milk until
they are four years old, and not until they have attained that age
do they feed them on grass. The dockn forms their substitute for
oats. The sheikhs of the Bakkara, seem nearly grown to their
horses, and are scarcely ever seen without them. They are of the
utmost service to them, in their wars<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_233">[233]</span> among themselves, and against their
neighbours; but more especially in capturing slaves. Their
remarkable fleetness renders them very useful in catching giraffes,
and ostriches even; but on the whole there are not so many horses
to be met with in this country as in the other provinces under the
sway of the Viceroy.</p>

<p>The most valuable gift nature has bestowed on the hot climates
of Africa, is undoubtedly the camel. The value of these animals to
the country is beyond calculation, independently of their utility
in carrying loads, which no other beast, except the elephant, could
bear, or would even be capable of drawing. The food of the camel
causes the drivers but little care, for contented with the worst
produce of the desert plains, namely, with thistles or a few
leaves, this animal will hold out for four days without feeding,
and even eight days without drinking, and yet it suffers no
appreciable loss of strength. Its paces are very sure, and it
scarcely ever falls, hence all goods, be they ever so fragile, may
be more safely transported by camels than they could possibly be by
any other animal, or by waggon. For loading or unloading, the camel
bends down, as it does also for the convenience of the rider, when
about to mount. If the load be too heavy, it instantly gives notice
of the circumstance to its driver by its groans. It requires no
whip, and keeps up its slow but progressive march without ever
breaking from the same pace. A laden camel will perform<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> eight miles in two hours. In
the cool of the morning or evening, and when cheered up by the
songs of the drivers, these animals become more lively, and
increase their paces to one third of their speed. Their organs of
sight and smell are very acute, for they scent the vicinity of
water at a distance of half a day’s journey or further, and make it
known by snuffing with the upper lip, in sign of pleasure. By night
they perform the office of a watchful dog; for if a man, or an
animal approach the caravan, or a wild beast give tongue even at a
great distance, the camels instantly perceive it, prick their ears,
and stretch their long necks towards the suspected quarter, to draw
the attention of their keepers to the interruption. Of no less
utility is the dromedary, a camel of more slender build, and broken
in for riding. It was formerly an erroneous hypothesis that the
dromedary was a different animal from the camel, and the former was
generally depicted with two humps; but this is a fallacy, for the
dromedary is nothing but a camel, and the variation in the name is
merely made use of by the inhabitants of the East to indicate that
it is broken-in for riding, and not for carrying loads. They select
from among the young camels such as are most slightly built, and
most light of foot, never lay any load upon their backs except the
saddle, and thus gradually break them in for this important
service. No horse can keep up with the dromedary, when proceeding
at full trot. When this animal is at the top of its speed, the
rider is obliged to bind a hand-kerchief<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_235">[235]</span> before his face, to avoid the effects of
the pressure of air, which would otherwise be painful to him. If a
dark speck, which quickly increases, be observed on the horizon, at
the greatest distance in the desert, a dromedary rider is sure to
be met in a few minutes, and the natives, in endeavouring to impart
a correct idea of the fleetness of these animals to the traveller,
have a saying: “If you meet a good dromedary, and the rider salute
you with <em>‘Es-selam’ aley’koom,’</em><a id=
"FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
both man and beast are out of sight before you can answer
<em>‘aley’koom es-selám.”</em> It requires, indeed, some practice
to be able to bear the exertion of riding these animals. Letters
from the southern provinces, are usually forwarded to Cairo by
couriers mounted on dromedaries, who generally require twenty-eight
days to perform a distance of about seventeen degrees of latitude.
For the accomplishment of this task, a relay of three or four
couriers is necessary. On important missions, however, one and the
same courier frequently performs the whole distance, merely
changing his dromedaries at the various stations. The rider is
always very lightly accoutred, and carries, besides his arms,
consisting of a sabre, a pair of pistols, and frequently also of a
long gun, two bags of moderate size for his provender, and a small
water-bag attached to his saddle-bow, and thus he sets out upon his
journey, which would prove a most arduous undertaking
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> any other
person, with the least possible incumbrance, and with no
uneasiness.</p>

<p>The flesh of the young camels, of the two or four years old, is
highly prized by the natives, more especially by the Nomadic
tribes, and forms their chief article of food. Many of them are
slaughtered at Lobeid, and the meat is sold at the same price as
beef, which some of the residents prefer. The milk is also a chief
article of consumption with many of the natives.</p>

<p>The asses, native to the country, are of a very inferior breed;
good donkeys are, therefore, still imported from Egypt by the
Djelabi. Horned cattle is more especially met with in vast numbers.
There are few villages in the neighbourhood, in which large herds
may not be seen at pasture; and amongst the Bakkara, the droves
consist even of thousands of heads. They feed throughout the year
in the open air, but suffer much from hunger in the dry season,
when everything is burnt to a cinder, and are, therefore, not so
fat at this period as during the rainy season, when they are,
literally speaking, up to their horns in grass. Thus thousands of
heads of cattle may be feeding in a meadow, and yet not one single
beast will be seen; their presence is merely denoted by the motion
of the grass. The kine, however, are not of very excellent breed,
they yield but little milk, of inferior quality, and much worse
beef. The Turks resident in Kordofan never eat this meat. Amongst
the Bakkara, a particular breed of short-horned oxen is
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> be met with,
furnished with a high hump, or deposition of fat above the
fore-quarters, and a dependent flap of skin below the neck and
chest, reaching downwards to the knee.<a id=
"FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
The oxen are chiefly used for riding, and carrying weights: a cord
passed through the nose of the animal forms a species of bridle.
They are instructed for these purposes at a very early age, and,
indeed, by children. The instruction, however, requires immense
patience, for many months frequently transpire before a young calf
will allow a lad to sit quietly on its back, and the boys meet with
innumerable falls, before they succeed in thoroughly breaking-in
one of these animals. In many parts of Africa, where the camel will
not live on account of the fly (yohara), oxen are only employed for
riding, and transporting loads. There are many sheep, and among
them one species of very large breed; they bear no wool, but short
hair; the mutton is of good flavour, and is preferred to beef, or
to the flesh of goats.</p>

<p>The goat is very common in the country, and may be reckoned
among the chief domestic animals. There are several varieties, or
rather cross breeds, and some of exceedingly elegant form; but they
are mostly very small. Nothing can induce the Turks to partake of
goat’s-milk during the rainy season; for they firmly believe that
it produces fever, if the animal should happen to have browsed the
leaves of a tree called, in Arabic, <em>escher</em> (<i>asclepias
procera</i>), and known as a poisonous plant. It is, in fact, the
tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> whence the
well-known poison is expressed, with which an obnoxious person was
quietly put out of the way with a fingán of coffee in former times
in Egypt, and is sometimes employed for the same purpose at the
present day. This plant may be met with occasionally as a shrub in
Upper Egypt; but in Kordofan it attains the height of a tree. Many
of the natives pay great attention to its cultivation, and lay the
leaves into the sieve, through which they filter their merissa.
These leaves contain a white milky juice, which is imparted to the
beer and said to render it very narcotic. I have often warned these
good people against its use; but they excuse themselves, by saying
that their fathers, and mothers made use of it before them. The
camel, not very particular in the selection of its food in general,
never touches the escher.<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> As regards the
superstition prevalent among the Turks, that the milk of the goats
generates fever, in consequence of their having fed off the foliage
of this poisonous plant, it is perfectly absurd; for it is a
well-known fact, that any kind of milk taken during the rainy
season will produce fever.</p>

<p>Dogs, of which there are a great number, run about, as in all
other mahommedan countries, without any real owners, and are yet
looked upon as domestic animals. They are mostly of a yellow
colour, but rather better shaped than the Egyptian dogs; like them
they feed off the garbage and fallen cattle, and are not otherwise
of the slightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
utility. I found, however, that they might be instructed for
sporting, with very little trouble. There are very few cats in the
country, hence the rats and the mice are so tame that they will run
across the feet of a person by day-time. If anything be thrown to
them for food, they immediately pick it up, devour it quickly, and
return fearlessly to fetch more. The natives of Kordofan take
little pains to destroy this vermin, and merely set snares in the
fields and gardens for the field rat, which is eaten by many
negroes, and even by some few of the Dongolavi. I myself saw the
Nuba negroes eating rats; they roast them in their skins, and flay
them after they are cooked. There is one species of rat, however,
which does not create the slightest disgust. It is of a
cream-colour, with a snow white belly and feet tipped with white,
and its coat is as sleek as silk. They may be classed amongst the
most elegant animals.</p>

<p>The fowls of this province are far larger than those of
Egypt—the cock birds more especially—and are decorated with a very
beautiful plumage, similar to those observed in Nubia. The tame
pigeons are likewise larger than those met with in Egypt, and I
counted nine different varieties of wood-pigeons, the smallest of
the size of a blackbird, but with a tail as long as the bird
itself.</p>

<p>The giraffe, one of the most beautiful animals of Africa, is
frequently seen in Kordofan, and nearly all the specimens of this
animal sent by way of Egypt to Europe and America, have been
caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> in the
plains of Kordofan. During the rainy season they are not to be met
with, for they are supposed to travel into countries situate at a
great distance from this province. The natives believe them to
betake themselves to parts where very little rain falls, as of all
the wild beasts of the torrid zone, none is so sensitive to climate
as the giraffe. In captivity they require the greatest care and
attention to keep them alive; in Egypt even they must be guarded
during the winter months against cold, and their diet, moreover,
demands the strictest attention, for instances are known of
giraffes dying very soon, in consequence of a trifling neglect on
the part of their keepers. As soon as the dry season commences, the
giraffes return to the neighbourhood of Kordofan; they are not
gregarious in their habits like the antelopes, and are only to be
seen separately, or at the most in pairs. These beautiful creatures
are caught by men on horseback, but merely the young animals are
taken alive, as it would almost amount to an impossibility to catch
an old beast, who would overthrow both horse and rider, and use
them very roughly. The latter are, therefore, slain with the sword,
merely for the sake of their skins, which form an article of trade.
The flesh is eaten, and has not exactly a disagreeable flavour. In
order to be allowed to hunt giraffes for a menagerie, it is
necessary first to obtain a firman from the minister of the
interior, and it is indeed the best plan to apply at once to the
Sheikh Abdel Had at Haraza; he<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_241">[241]</span> will immediately give an order to his
people who occupy themselves with this sport, for it requires not
only a very expert horseman, but a very perfect horse, and more
especially experience in this species of hunting. Generally
speaking, two horsemen provided with one or two camels laden with a
supply of provender and water sufficient for a few days, proceed
into the desert frequented by the giraffes. The camels are left at
an appropriate place, whilst the riders reconnoitre the country
until they come upon the track of an animal. Great experience is
now requisite to distinguish whether the trace be of to-day or
yesterday, or of a yet older date. If it be recent, and that of a
young animal, it is immediately followed up, and the huntsmen may
make sure of gaining a sight of their prey in a few hours. As soon
as the giraffe is in view, the run instantly takes place, for the
animal, very timid by nature, seeks refuge in flight, and indeed
with extraordinary fleetness. Everything now depends on the
dexterity of the rider, and activity of his horse. They must do all
in their power to gain upon the game they have started, an
endeavour which is the more readily to be effected, as the giraffe
never takes a straight course, but by nature timid, doubles, in the
fear of its life, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left,
and is thus quickly overtaken by the horsemen. Having come up with
the young animal pursued, the rider casts a lasso over its head;
his throw but seldom fails, and in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_242">[242]</span> worst case must be repeated. He then
attaches the end of the rope to his saddle, drags the animal as
closely as he can to his horse, and thus the capture is effected.
But now a steady and patient horse, well broken to its work, is
again necessary for the further transport; for the horse must
resist the animal’s efforts, or give way to them (for it pulls and
jumps in all directions), in conveying it to the nearest village,
which the huntsmen endeavour to reach as quickly as they possibly
can. A she-camel should stand in readiness there to give the young
giraffe milk, with which it is fed before being weaned to grass or
hay. This treatment must be subsequently followed, and even full
grown giraffes should receive milk daily as drink, if it be in any
way possible.</p>

<p>When the young animal has rested for some time, it is furthered,
without delay, to Dongola, but on this occasion great attention is
again required. A kind of head-stall is put on the animal’s head,
to which four stout cords are fastened. Two men, each holding the
end of one of the ropes in his hand, walk in front, and two follow,
to keep its gait steady, a task requiring during the first few days
extraordinary exertion. A she-camel must accompany the young
giraffe to give it the necessary nourishment on the road. Arrived
at Dongola, a certain time is again devoted to rest, and the animal
is here accustomed to the milk of the cow and to grass. It is
incredible what difficulties<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_243">[243]</span> the Arabs have to contend with in
preserving a giraffe alive, and it is, consequently, not to be
wondered at that their price is so enormous. In Egypt, for example,
at Cairo or Alexandria, a living specimen always costs from five to
six hundred dollars.</p>

<p>There are not many leopards in this province; the stragglers
merely from the interior of Africa show themselves occasionally in
Kordofan. They will sometimes approach the villages, but instances
of their having done an injury to man are very rare. They mostly
steal their prey from one of the herds, but immediately withdraw
with it to their covert, but are by no means as bold as they may be
in the more internal tracts of this and another quarter of the
globe. They are not hunted, partly from want of fire-arms, partly
because the skin, the only portion of value about them, is not much
in request, and a leopard is very rarely, indeed, known to have
been killed in any district. Hyænas, of which there are said to be
three varieties, are far more numerous. The striped species is the
most common in Egypt and Syria; but the tiger-skinned hyæna is far
larger, and if the third variety exist it has never come under my
own observation. They form herds of ten or twenty animals, secrete
themselves during the day in the caves and ravines of the
neighbouring mountains, which they merely quit at night, when they
go in quest of prey, and on these occasions they<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> gradually separate. Dead
bodies, which they dig out of the graves, are their favourite food,
and they immediately scent out where a corpse has been interred,
whether in the desert or in the burial-ground. They are also fond
of picking out the young sheep from a flock, although these are
enclosed during the night within a dense fence of thorn-hedging.
The hyæna, however, understands mining, digs beneath the fence, and
frequently breaks in upon a flock. They never do any harm to man,
and there is scarcely a single instance on record of a hyæna having
seized upon a man, and those, indeed, known, were only occasions
where they had been greatly irritated or wounded. In Europe, this
animal is very much calumniated as being the most ferocious and
most cruel of all wild beasts, thus, at least, it is described in
nearly all the books on natural history; one author, in fact,
copies the error from the other, without investigating his subject
more closely; hence the opinion first gained ground and
subsequently became prevalent in the whole of Europe, that the
hyæna is the most formidable of all quadrupeds. I and several other
Europeans have convinced ourselves, that it is not only not feared,
but totally disregarded by the natives. It is timid, may be cowed
by blows, and rather endeavours to secrete itself than to attack.
The circumstance of its disinterring dead bodies and devouring them
is no proof of its being the most formidable or ferocious
animal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> for if it
can surprise sheep or gazelles, it prefers them, but hunger
oftentimes forces it to dig up a corpse, and feed off it. Its
forepaws are certainly adapted by nature for digging in the earth,
but there are sufficient instances of dogs having scratched out the
bodies of the dead and eaten them. In Hungary, Poland, and Russia,
examples of wolves attacking men are very numerous; in Africa, the
instances of the hyæna having done the same are very scarce. Ten
hyænas may, in fact, be sooner tamed than one jackal. Thus, in the
court of a house at Lobeid, I saw a hyæna running about quite
domesticated: the children of the proprietor teased it, took the
meat thrown to it for food out of its jaws, and put their hands
even into its throat, without receiving the least injury. When we
took our meals in the open air, to enjoy the breeze, as was our
general custom during the hot season, this animal approached the
table without fear, snapped up the pieces that were thrown to it
like a dog, and did not evince the slightest symptom of timidity. A
full grown hyæna, and her two cubs, were, on another occasion,
brought to me for sale: the latter were carried in arms, as you
might carry a lamb, and were not even muzzled. The old one, it is
true, had a rope round its snout, but it had been led a distance of
twelve miles by one single man, without having offered the
slightest resistance. The Africans do not even reckon the hyæna
among the wild beasts of their country, for they are not afraid of
it. The rhinoceros<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
passes among them as the most vicious of all quadrupeds. They say
the lion, and other beasts of prey, merely attack man when they are
wounded or irritated, or when goaded on by hunger; and as there are
sheep and goats everywhere, and numbers of antelopes and other
animals, in the desert, and they suffer no want of food, man need
not fear them. Widely different is the case with the rhinoceros,
for although it is a graminivorous animal, neither man nor beast
are safe from its wanton cruelty. Without having been disturbed or
irritated in the least, it will immediately attack a man or animal,
be it ever so large—even the elephant or lion. It endeavours in the
first charge to pierce its adversary with its powerful horn, which
is situated, as is well known, superiorly on the nasal bone, taking
a curved direction upwards. If the first blow take effect, the
animal attacked, even if it be the elephant, is lost; should he, or
the lion, however, avoid the blow, the rhinoceros generally
succumbs, and notwithstanding this risk it is always the aggressor.
Fortunately there are said to be but very few rhinoceroses; and it
is indeed a great rarity if one of them happen to stray into
Kordofan. The haunts of these animals are in the vicinity of rivers
and lakes, their horns may be met with in commerce, and are
employed in the manufacture of the handles of the Turkish swords.
The lighter the colour of the horn the greater is its value; but
the black variety is not in request, and is regarded as useless for
sabre hilts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> The
quality of the horns cannot be judged of by their outward
appearance, for externally they are all black. Those which are met
with in commerce in Kordofan are imported from the countries
tributary to Darfour, situated on a river,—probably the White
Nile,—of which I shall speak more fully in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p>The number of lions in this province is not very considerable,
but they frequently enter villages for prey, and carry away a head
of cattle before their visit is even suspected. In the day time
they are neither heard nor seen, for they generally lie crouching
in a dense covert, or sleeping beneath a shady tree. But early in
the morning, as soon as the sun begins to cast its rays on the
sandy billows of the desert, the royal animal rises from his lair
to sally forth in quest of prey. His voice may then be heard in the
distance; it commences with a low murmuring, which gradually
increases, until it at last becomes a fearful and terrific roar,
like the rolling of thunder, and is audible at a distance of two
miles. The whole animal kingdom trembles, and evinces the greatest
fear when the king of the beasts is heard; the sheep tremble as if
attacked with ague, place their heads together, and endeavour to
hide themselves; the horses break out into a sweat with fear; and
the dogs hurry away as fast as they can to find a place of refuge.
In fine, all the beasts are seized with the most unequivocal terror
when the lion makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
his approach known. Should a caravan happen to be near the spot, it
is impossible to keep the camels together, they leap about in all
directions, and are scattered abroad under the influence of fear. I
myself once had the opportunity of witnessing a scene of this kind.
On arriving in my travels at the wells of Semmeria, we suddenly
heard a murmuring noise afar, resembling the rolling of balls in an
empty barrel; but we were soon acquainted with its true cause when
it gradually increased to that terrible thunder-like roar. With the
first perception of this noise, the camels belonging to our caravan
suddenly took fright, and instantly separated in all directions.
The men and the cases were thrown off, and if one of the riders
happened to keep his seat at the first alarm, he was subsequently
necessitated to leap down, to avoid being felled by the branches of
the trees; for we were unfortunately near a forest of mimosas, and
every one was in danger of being torn by their large spines. This
confusion, however, did not last long, for the lion took quite an
opposite direction to the route of our caravan; but a whole day was
lost in collecting the goods that had been thrown off, or torn down
by the trees, and one of the camels strayed to a great distance.
Lions are seldom hunted in this country; for there are very few of
them, as I have before-mentioned, and they do so little damage that
it would not be worth while to incur the danger attending the
sport. The flesh of the lord of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> forest is very tough and tendinous, and is
not readily devoured by any other animal. A dog will sneak away as
soon as he smells it.</p>

<p>A few panthers may be met with in the country, but they are not
as large as those of Asia. I have been assured that there are no
tigers in Kordofan. Antelopes may be seen browsing in large
numbers, and, indeed, in great variety; like the camels, they are
able to bear thirst for eight days. I have myself observed them in
places situated at a distance of twenty-six miles from any water,
so that it would have been impossible for them to perform this
journey daily, or even on every other day.</p>

<p>Besides the animals mentioned, there are a number of quadrupeds,
the names of which are not even known in Europe; for Kordofan has
only been visited, up to the present day, by two naturalists,
<i>viz.</i>, by Dr. Rueppell and Dr. Kotschy, who remained too
short a time in the country to have been able to traverse it, and
explore it in all directions. A residence of a few years would at
least be required to investigate everything thoroughly; and all
those who have resided in the country hitherto have suffered so
much by the unhealthy climate, that they have been obliged to leave
it as quickly as possible, to avoid the danger threatening the life
of every European.</p>

<p>The various species of birds arriving in this country at the
different seasons of the year, and leaving it again at others, are
very numerous, and vary from the little colibri to the gigantic
ostrich. As they are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_250">[250]</span> not often frightened by the noise of
fire-arms they are not timid and may be easily shot; but if the
traveller sojourn for some days in one spot and pursue them with
his gun, they then of course soon become as shy here as in other
places. Several of the birds, and this applies more especially to
the varieties of pigeons, are so little accustomed to fire-arms
that, although many will fall at one shot, those which are not hit
will remain quietly perched on the tree. I must also draw the
attention of all travellers who may be sportsmen to the fact that
the birds become very shy if they observe a Turkish attire and a
red cap or turboosh, whereas if the sportsman wear a blue shirt and
brown cap, after the fashion of Upper-Egypt, he may be sure of
killing double the number he would in the dress above-mentioned.
The black storks occupy nearly every house in the villages; each
hut is furnished with a basket, which forms the apex of its roof,
and serves these birds as a nest, thus saving them the trouble of
building for themselves. He who might venture to do an injury to a
stork would expose himself to the greatest abuse from the natives;
and were the dread of the white men not overawing, he might even
subject himself to sensible proofs of their displeasure; for, as
regards these birds, they are as superstitious as the people in
some parts of Europe about the white stork. They are in consequence
so tame that they run about the villages like geese, and I
frequently had to throw my stick at<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_251">[251]</span> them when collecting insects in their
company in a meadow, for they were far quicker in picking them up
than I was, and would frequently snatch a beetle away from me when
I had my hand upon it. The sacred ibis, of the ancient Egyptians,
appears to be a native of Kordofan: it builds its nest on trees in
the villages, and I have often counted from twenty to fifty of them
on one tree. I have altogether seldom seen animals living as
peacably among themselves as these birds. They hatch their young,
two in number,—rarely three,—during the rainy season; they enjoy
the same good opinion of men as the storks, but even to a greater
degree; for when I was about to kill a few, near the house of
Sultan Temé, at Lobeid, he said very solemnly: “Rather shoot all
the fowls in my court, than one of these ibises, which have come to
my trees to build their nests, and sought my protection.” When the
young birds are full grown, the old ones migrate, and return with
the first fall of rain. I could not find out where they resort to
during the dry season; in the time of the ancient Egyptians, they
evidently went to Egypt, as the many thousands of ibis-vases met
with at Sakara and in other situations would prove; but at present
they are never to be seen in that country. I have, indeed,
occasionally observed a single bird of this species on the White
River, as late as the month of April; but I suppose these to have
been invalids incapable of following the flight.</p>

<p>The ostrich may be reckoned among the most<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_252">[252]</span> useful birds; for its flesh is eaten,
and that of the young birds is of very pleasant flavour. The price
of a young ostrich is five piasters (1<em>s.</em> 5½<em>d.</em>
sterling). The eggs are also eaten, one of them is sufficient to
satisfy four persons. The egg-shells are exported as an article of
commerce, but the feathers return the largest profits. A full-grown
ostrich will always yield three rottoli of black feathers, and half
a rottolo of white plumes. The greater number of these birds are
caught in Caccie in snares, placed on a plate, matted from the wood
of a species of willow, perforated with holes, and buried in the
sand. The gin itself, which is laid upon this plate, is bound to
the nearest tree, or to a piece of wood. As many as fifty of these
are laid in a certain spot. If an ostrich, or a gazelle, happen to
stray into these parts, and set its foot on one of the plates, the
snare opens; and as soon as the leg is withdrawn, it closes again,
and the animal is caught. It would, indeed, be almost impossible to
capture one of these birds in any other way, for they are
exceedingly cautious, and very quick of sight; as soon, therefore,
as they descry a man approaching them, they immediately take to
flight. To overtake the bird, even with the fleetest steed, would
be a matter of great difficulty, for, scarcely touching the ground
with its feet, it runs so fast, that it appears almost to fly; and
the illusion is still greater when the motion of its short wings is
observed, which it uses as propellers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>The natives of
Kordofan draw but little profit from all these products of the
animal and vegetable kingdoms; for, independently of their not
understanding how to turn the various articles to advantage, or
rather to perfect them by art or industry, they are too lazy to do
any thing more, than is necessary for their absolute maintenance.
Very few artisans are, consequently, to be found among them: they
consist of a few weavers of calicos, smiths, tanners, and potters.
The cottons the natives produce are not sufficient for the supply
of the country, hence the greater part of the consumption is
imported from Dongola, Egypt, and Europe. Not that there is a
deficiency of the necessary means for cultivating a larger quantity
of raw cotton, or for manufacturing it; but they will not take the
slightest trouble about it, because all their labour would be
purchased by the government at an arbitrary price, which would not
repay the workman for his trouble, and they, therefore, prefer to
lie about idle all the day long, or to pass their time with useless
games. It is really an interesting sight to watch a weaver at his
work; and I know not which is more astonishing, the simplicity of
the implements with which he toils, or the patience he displays in
his occupation. The weavers can only work in the dry season,
because their houses are too small to allow them to fit up a loom
in them; they consequently place the frames close to the door of
their huts, and work in that situation. An European weaver, even
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> most expert in
his art, would be greatly puzzled if put to one of these looms, and
would scarcely know how to begin his work, so primitive are they in
construction. Four stout sticks, are driven into the ground, to
which the reed and other parts of the apparatus are attached; the
weft is expanded at a distance of scarcely one span from the
ground, bound to a pole to which a stone is attached, and then
drawn along with it. The frame is of the dimensions the piece
manufactured is required to have, and is sometimes twenty ells in
length. The weaver stands in a pit before his loom, and casts his
shuttle at a venture. With every second throw his thread breaks,
and then it takes him double the time to tie it again; but nothing
disturbs the equanimity of the weaver, he ties his knot with the
greatest patience, and again throws his shuttle, again breaks his
thread, and again readjusts it. Thus it is impossible to conceive
the space of time required to finish a piece about twenty ells in
length. They do not understand how to manufacture woven goods from
goats’ hair.</p>

<p>The smiths are the most industrious workmen; they fabricate all
the necessary household and agricultural implements, are at the
same time miners, and smelters of ore; for they dig the iron from
the bowels of the earth themselves, and melt it after a very simple
process; but they do not understand how to harden it. They have no
fixed workshops, but arrange them wheresoever they may happen
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> find work; the
fitting up of the forge costs them but little trouble, for a large
stone is soon found on which they place a piece of iron, this
serves them then as an anvil; close to this essential instrument,
they construct a small furnace, to which a leather sack, answering
the purpose of bellows, is attached. They make no heavy objects,
for, beyond spear-heads, hashiash, (an agricultural implement,)
double-edged, and arrow-pointed knives of various sizes, they
cannot produce any other article. Their work is not well rewarded;
for the minerals, such as the iron or charcoal cost them scarcely
anything, and thus they can only bring their manual labour into
calculation. Their tools are not particularly complicated, and
consist merely of a few hammers and of a pair of pincers.</p>

<p>The potters manufacture one single kind of vessel
(<em>Bursha</em>) in form of a bomb, but with rather a wider neck,
and this is used as a receptacle for water, for boiling, roasting,
and for keeping merissa in; they make, further, a round and rather
deepened plate (<em>Doga</em>) for baking bread, and pipe-heads
more of a German shape than like the Turkish bowls; all these
articles are, however, perfectly plain without the slightest
attempt even at ornament.</p>

<p>There are many tanners in the province who tan the leather by a
most simple process, in which they employ the Garat,<a id=
"FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
the pod of a tree. They also manufacture the water-holders, the
larger of which, are termed <em>Rai</em>, the smaller
<em>Ckir’beh</em>;<a id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_256">[256]</span> the latter are generally made of goats’
hides, as in Egypt; the goats being skinned for this purpose like
hares; the interior of the skin is merely tanned, whilst the hair
is left externally; leathern bags are also fabricated to serve the
office of churns. Of leather they produce further sandals, shoes,
rahads, and, lastly, shields. The rahad is a girdle fringed by many
thousands of small straps, and is generally one, or half a span in
length; the girls wear these fringes round their loins, and they
are usually decorated with agates and small shells. Shields are
mostly manufactured from the hide of the large antelopes; they are
of an ovoid shape, furnished with a protuberance in the centre. On
the inner surface, a piece of wood bisects them longitudinally, to
which two straps are attached to receive the arm; they are very
stout, for a thrust with a spear or a sabre-cut scarcely ever
penetrates them. The sheep-skins they tan very neatly, and impart
to them a red, yellow, green, or other optional colour, by means of
the juice of certain plants; the natives bind their shoes, ornament
their sandals, or sew up charms with this coloured leather; they
also prepare sheaths for knives and other articles from it.</p>

<p>The women plait some very ornamental articles from the foliage
of the <i>Palma Thebaica</i>, further, bread-baskets named
<em>Tabak</em>, covers for dishes, mats, &amp;c. They dye the
leaves in different colours, and decorate them with patterns that
are really astonishing.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_257">[257]</span> They also manufacture funnels for straining
merissa, and baskets for keeping milk. The latter so densely worked
that, when the fluid has once permeated them, they do not even
leak. Every description of work performed in this country is very
simple, and it is only to be wondered at, that the natives are able
to produce thus much, as they labour under a deficiency of
implements of all kinds.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span><a id=
"c14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<span class="med">THE CAPITAL OF KORDOFAN, LOBEID.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Lobeid</span>, or Labayet, as it is also
termed, is a town composed of several villages, from one of which
it neither differs in its external appearance nor internal
arrangements, excepting, perhaps, in being of greater extent. The
houses, like those of the villages, are mere huts of straw, some
few of them are, indeed, built of clay, but not one single house is
of stone. The former town of the same name was totally destroyed by
the Turks when they took possession of Kordofan, and the six
villages, of which the capital of this province now consists, were
subsequently built on the same site. Although these villages are
not separated from each other by the intervention of a large space,
yet each of them forms a separate quarter, and is inhabited by a
distinct class of men. <em>Wady Naghele</em>, the first of these,
is entirely inhabited by the Dongolavi and foreign merchants;
<em>El-Orta</em>, the camp, also named the town of the Turks, is
the quarter in which the government buildings are situated,
consisting of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Barracks, the arsenal, the hospital and the residences of the
officers, and of many married soldiers living out of barrack; in
this quarter of the town the Bazaar is also seen. <em>Wady
Soffie</em> is the place of abode of the negroes who immigrated
with the Melik-Moussalem; <em>Takarir</em> or <em>Takruri</em>, is
the village of the pilgrims, where the greater part of the negroes
from Pergu and other districts reside. In this part of the town the
straw-huts of <em>Abumedina</em>, the brother of the Sultan of
Darfûr,<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a> are also situate. In <em>Kongeri</em> those
emigrants from Darfûr dwell, who have become residents, and
remained after the conquest of the country by the Egyptian troops.
The sixth village includes the new buildings of the
<em>Mogghrebeen</em>, who are not provided with barracks, and have
themselves built their own dwellings. These six villages
collectively form the town of Lobeid. I estimate the number of
inhabitants, exclusively of the military, at 12,000 souls. The
houses named in the language of the country, Tukkoli, are mostly
huts, similar to those described on a former occasion. The town
does not present a very pleasing appearance, and is, on the whole,
exceedingly dull and dismal, for very few large houses are to be
seen, and not even one minaret, met with in nearly every village in
Egypt, which, with the date-trees planted around them, give those
villages at least a more cheerful aspect.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more monotonous than the appearance<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> of the town during the dry
season, when the detached houses present themselves with all their
defects and meanness, and the scanty trees and gardens offer no
diversification of scenery; for the former then stand as bald as
brooms, and the latter are not even thought of. The burning sand,
moreover, serves to remind the traveller that he is in a desert,
and there is not the slightest object to be seen that might delight
his eye.</p>

<p>How marked is the contrast in the rainy season! It is difficult
to persuade yourself that it is the same place you have shortly
before seen standing in barren nakedness. All those spots, where
nothing but sand was to be observed before, are now clad with a
most luxuriant verdure, interspersed with the most beautiful
flowers. The hedges round the houses are interlaced with a variety
of creepers and twining plants, whose variegated flowers afford a
most pleasing spectacle. The environs of the houses are cultivated
with dockn, which stands so high that the tops of the roofs are
only to be seen projecting beyond it; not a single house can be
descried at a distance, and the whole country appears like one
large forest. The entire town then resembles a park intersected by
mazes, rendering it difficult for a stranger to extricate himself,
or to find out a particular house. His embarrassment is greatly
augmented by the circumstance of there being several thousands of
small straw huts, and by the close resemblance<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_261">[261]</span> of the houses to each other—for all are
built alike—so that the stranger experiences much trouble in even
recognising the house he may be lodging in. But all this is in its
way unique, and diverts the eye. The traveller wanders with
pleasure through these thousands and thousands of intricate paths,
and is delighted at every step with the beautiful variations in the
scene. At this time, however, the tropical showers set in, bringing
a number of disagreeables in their train; for the rain falls so
suddenly, and in such abundance, that the soil in some places
cannot absorb the water with sufficient rapidity; and thus streams
are formed, or the ground is ploughed up into beds, which fill in
an instant, rendering the intercourse between one quarter and the
other, or even from house to house, very difficult, if they do not
totally impede all communication. There are no bridges, not even as
much as boards laid down to facilitate the passage over these
brooks, and he who is obliged by business to go out immediately
after the rain, has no alternative but to wade through all these
streams and puddles barefooted. It would be impracticable at this
period to ride a donkey even, for notwithstanding their sureness of
foot, the ground is so uneven that they must tread into holes, and
both man and beast would run the risk of being drowned. Nearly
every year there are instances of loss of life from men venturing
to go from hut to hut by night, and it is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_262">[262]</span> really advisable to remain confined to the
house until these torrents are lost in the sand, as is very soon
the case.</p>

<p>As soon as the harvest is concluded, and the stubble is quite
dry, the natives proceed to burn the remaining herbage. This
occupation offers a very singular spectacle. The grass is in part
collected into heaps, and old and young congregate around them to
witness the exhibition which ensues: the pile is ignited, and a
dense smoke issues from it. Disturbed by the fumes, and frightened
by the noise of the multitude, thousands of locusts, which had lain
concealed in the grass, fly up, but are quickly seized upon by the
bystanders, impaled and roasted, and offered for sale in the
market-place, at the price of five for one para or hassasch; they
constitute a favourite dish with the natives, by whom they are
greedily devoured. After this act of purification the place again
presents itself to view in all its nakedness, and many other
matters come to light, which had hitherto been hidden by the grass:
bones of men and animals lie scattered about in all the roads, for
no one thinks it worth his trouble to inter them. The cause of this
barbarity will be readily understood when it is known that, as soon
as a slave dies, a rope is bound round his foot, by which he is
dragged out of the hut with as little ceremony as a dead beast, and
scraped into the sand anywhere, or even left to decompose in the
grass until the hyænas come to gnaw his bones in the night; the
remains are devoured<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_263">[263]</span> in the morning by the dogs, two or more of
which may not unfrequently be seen fighting over a human arm or
foot. The hyænas are really in some respects a blessing to these
countries, they are, in fact, the scavengers, consume all the dead
bodies and garbage, and thus prevent the air from being poisoned
with miasmata and nauseous vapours. A fallen animal is treated in
the same manner as a dead slave; it is thrown on to the neighbours’
territory, and is likewise devoured in the night by the beasts of
prey; whilst the remainder is enjoyed during the day by the hungry
dogs, in company with greedy vultures, eagles, and other rapacious
birds. The places of sepulture are not held sacred by these
uninvited guests; for the dead bodies being generally very
superficially covered over with earth, they are disinterred at
night by the hyænas and ravenous dogs, and totally consumed, or the
remains are left exposed in the high roads.</p>

<p>Lobeid counts five mosques, only one of which is a brick
building. This is situated in the quarter of Wady-Naghele; it is
quite a plain edifice, without that decoration so generally
observed about the places of worship in Egypt. All the other public
buildings, as also the houses belonging to the chief Turks, are
simple huts of clay, differing from the others merely in their
internal arrangements, which consist, however, only in the
construction of a few divans. There are three barracks at Lobeid,
constituted by a series of straw-huts, likewise about fifty in
number, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> are
enclosed by a fence, furnished with an entrance, the gate of which
is represented by a large branch of a tree. The hospital, that
terror of all the soldiery, is also erected of clay. One of the
largest buildings in Lobeid is the governor’s residence. It is
distinguished from the other houses only by its magnitude, and a
rather more comfortable arrangement of its interior, for in
construction it resembles all the other buildings. There is, in
fact, no choice of material; thus the palaces of the great, and the
hovels of the lower orders, are raised of clay, and their outer
walls covered with a coating of cow-dung. Besides a large saloon
and court, the government-house has an orangery. In the court, at
the back of the house, the divan, or chamber of audience, is
situated, where public business is transacted, and the visits are
received of foreigners and natives, as also of all subordinates,
who, according to Eastern custom, are obliged to do honour to the
governor periodically. To the left of this saloon is the lesser
divan, as it is called, in which a captain disposes of the less
important matters, or arranges disputes, and other trifling
affairs, that the governor may not be unnecessarily troubled. The
scriptoria of the Coptic secretaries, met with in all Mehemed Ali’s
divans are situate on the left of the court. During my residence in
Kordofan, Mahommed Bey, colonel of the first regiment of the line,
was at the same time civil and military governor of the province.
This man, a Circassian<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_265">[265]</span> by birth, who was brought as a slave to
Egypt, became a mameluke of Mehemed Ali’s, and in a short time rose
to his present high station. He is a man of very limited capacity,
without the slightest education, and is entirely governed by his
dependants and flatterers. Besides his ignorance, he possessed a
very large share of pride, and knew how to keep up the appearance
of great importance and dignity; he passed, however, the greater
part of his time in conversation with a fakeér, to whom he paid far
more attention than to his other subordinates, and whose visits
were far more agreeable to him than those of his officers. He could
not write at all, could read but little, and only understood how to
make the impression of his kashef<a id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> (seal). If instructions,
or other orders, arrived from Cairo, his secretary, a copt, was
obliged to read them aloud, and when he came to a passage which was
to be kept secret, he stopped him, and ordered him to finish it in
his private room; the reports for Egypt were then laid before him
to seal with his kashef: the remainder of his time he passed in
smoking, and drinking coffee; he very rarely walked in the open
air, or rode. To drink twenty or thirty cups of coffee daily was to
him a trifle, for as soon as a visitor arrived, he<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> merely looked at the
attendants in the apartment, who understood his meaning instantly,
and brought coffee and pipes, the former was kept in an adjacent
room continually on the fire. It is a rule and should be made
general to pay the governor visits of etiquette, as they are
termed, at certain times, for the Turks attach great importance to
this custom, and a neglect of this mark of respect might give
offence. Very often visitors arrive, who, after a mute salutation,
sit down, as soon as invited to do so, drink the coffee presented
to them, and in a short time rise, taking their departure as mutely
as they came, with a silent greeting.</p>

<p>The ammunition, and other military stores, are contained in an
appropriate building, enclosed by a mud wall, and surrounded by a
fosse, which is, however, scantily supplied with water during three
months, and remains empty for the remainder of the year. The wall
is constructed of clay, and might easily be breached by stones. It
may be imagined what superintendence is there prevalent; and it is
really astonishing that an invasion is not undertaken on the part
of the natives of Darfour to revenge themselves for the loss of
their stolen camels, more especially at the time of the
slave-hunts, when nearly the whole of the military force is absent,
and the entire garrison of Kordofan does not consist of six hundred
men. They might very soon, and with but little trouble at that
time, capture or destroy all the military supplies, and before a
reinforcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> could
be despatched from the Nuba mountains, the enemy might plunder and
sack everything without meeting with the slightest resistance.</p>

<p>Opposite the government buildings the gallows is erected. This
engine of civilization is composed of two posts driven vertically
into the ground, and surmounted by a cross-beam, to which the
victims of a rigid penal law are suspended, without further
ceremony. Not far from the fatal scaffold is an elevation, or clay
mound, furnished with a few steps, where the priest reads a prayer
on high-feasts, the service being only attended by the male
population of the town. The Soock, or proper market-place, is
contiguous to this mound. It would be an egregious fallacy to
imagine that order reigned here predominant, as in other towns in
the equally uncivilized East; for not only are all objects intended
for sale jumbled pell-mell together, and exposed without
consideration to the inclemencies of the weather, and other
destructive influence, but it costs, moreover, indescribable
trouble to obtain even such articles as you may be willing to
purchase. Close to this market-place on the right, stands the only
coffee-house in the whole province of Kordofan. In the year 1838 it
was closed, and no tenant was to be found for a considerable time
on account of the high rent demanded by the government; the price
of coffee had also risen at this period to eighteen piasters (five
shillings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span> and
threepence) the rottolo (about three quarters of a pound), as none
had arrived from Abyssinia. In the year 1839 the establishment was
again opened by the new governor Yussuff-Bey, in consideration of
this beverage being so indispensable to the Turkish officers.</p>

<p>The remaining store-houses consist of three walls of clay
covered in by a thatched roof; the goods are here laid down on the
sand and exposed, as I before mentioned, to all weathers. The upper
part of the market-place is appropriated to the sale of dockn,
camels, cows, sheep, goats, asses, and other domestic animals; next
to these may be seen the djelabi with the commodity they have
brought from Cairo lying on the sand; then come the water-dealers,
and lastly, at either side of the soock, the women exhibit
themselves, sitting down in four or six rows, to sell sour milk,
butter, lard, garden and wild fruits; they bring also in addition
to the articles mentioned, tobacco pipe-bowls, eggs, etc., for
sale; the stands of the dealers in wood and grass are contiguous to
these, and occupy a large extent of the market-place, for as wood
and grass may be collected by any one, there is considerable
competition in this branch of trade. The portion of the market
occupied by the women, affords a most singular sight, for they sit
crowded together without order or regard for personal comfort, and
the small vacant space is densely filled with buyers, who will not
budge an inch to make room for each<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_269">[269]</span> other; thus, in order to move from place to
place, you have, literally speaking, to walk over the heads of the
women, cowering down on the ground, and they allow this want of
gallantry without a murmur. Altogether, that quarrelling, so common
in Egyptian markets, is never to be heard here. Beside the
retailers and venders, the public criers must be mentioned; these
people deal in old clothes and other articles, and have no
permanent stand, but holding the object for sale high up in their
hands, dispose of it according to the custom in other towns in
Egypt, to the highest bidder. This description of auction is not
carried on at a fixed place, for the auctioneer, bawling out the
price last bid, presses through the crowd of human beings, and runs
from place to place until an advance is made, whereupon he is
obliged to return to the former bidder, and inform him that his
offer has been superseded. It is very remarkable that these criers
can always accurately find out the man who has made a bid for the
article in question, and thus expressed a wished to become a
purchaser, in the immense crowd. If no one advance on the last
offer the article put up for sale is delivered after several
perambulations to the highest bidder. This species of auction is
the public sale in common vogue in Egypt. If an European die
leaving many effects, a formal auction is advertised by his
respective consul, and the chattels are publicly sold in the same
manner as in Europe; inconsiderable<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_270">[270]</span> relics are, however, disposed of by the
criers above-mentioned. Market lasts at Lobeid generally from three
o’clock in the afternoon until sunset; for the heat during the day
being insupportable, no one leaves his house without cogent
reasons, before three in the afternoon, and it would thus be
useless for the merchants and dealers to congregate in the
market-place at an early hour.</p>

<p>Provisions and articles of domestic economy produced in the
country are, generally speaking, cheap; but in Lobeid, as in all
other capitals, they are more expensive than in the environs, where
they may be procured at a distance of eight or twelve miles from
the town, at two-thirds of their cost in the market-place. A large
sheep, the price of which is from fifteen to eighteen piasters in
Lobeid, may be bought in the villages, at a distance of not quite
twelve miles from the town, for six piasters at the utmost, and the
same observation applies proportionately to all other provisions.
The price of the finest camels is on an average one hundred and
fifty piasters, that of ordinary animals from forty to eighty
piasters (from eight to sixteen shillings). The most revolting
scene on the Soock, is the sale of slaves, which takes place every
day throughout the year. The unfortunate being offered for sale is
led about like any other commodity by the crier, who expatiates
upon the beauty, or other characteristics of the slave, and walking
before him, bawls out the price. If a purchaser present himself, he
enters upon an examination<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_271">[271]</span> of his fellow creature, as we should
examine a head of cattle, in Europe; he looks at his teeth, eyes,
hands, and feet, and inquires into his age, place of birth, and in
short, into every circumstance which might influence his price
while the unfortunate wretch follows the crier like a dog,
anxiously awaiting his future fate. A mother may not be separated
from the infant at her breast, but children of three or four years
of age may be disposed of separately; the latter are very
reasonable; their price varies only from thirty to sixty piasters
(eight and sixpence to seventeen shillings). Full-grown slaves
fluctuate according to the supply of the market; girls and boys
from ten to fifteen years of age, are in the greatest request, and
cost from one hundred to three hundred piasters; if there be few
for sale, and many Djelabi are about to travel to Cairo, the price,
of course, rises. There are certain conditions under which a slave
may be returned to the vender, <i>e. g.</i> if he have offensive
breath, or snore in his sleep, or be troubled with incontinence of
urine, for any one of these vices he may be sent back at the
expiration of the third day; should a female slave be pregnant, the
term is somewhat prolonged. The slave-trade is not always carried
on in retail, for the Djelabi buy slaves in lots; on these
occasions, however, the individuals are singly examined, and the
aged and infirm are separated from the flock. The chief object is
to have as many young girls and boys as possible in a lot, and to
be able to transport<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_272">[272]</span> them safely to Egypt; thus every one in
purchasing a male or female slave, looks chiefly to their age, and
a boy or girl, beyond the thirteenth or fifteenth year, is seldom
sold in the bazaar of Cairo or Alexandria; every one, in fact,
prefers bringing them up according to his own taste, and for this
purpose selects the youngest. The older women and men exposed for
sale in the bazaar, of the towns above named, are mostly such as
are resold by their masters for some particular defect, and it is
by no means, therefore, advisable to purchase them.</p>

<p>The soock, or market is the only place of diversion for the
European or stranger in general, at Lobeid. Besides the pleasing
spectacle afforded by the bustle of the place, the crowd, and
various groups of dealers and Djelabs, all the Turkish officers,
Coptic secretaries, and the few foreign merchants collect in the
market-place, around the single coffee-house we have before
mentioned, where each man endeavours to surpass the other in
retailing news. Although deep in the interior of Africa, there is
no lack of news from the most distant parts of the world; and even
when at the time of the heavy rains the communication with Egypt is
interrupted, intelligence may be heard every day from that quarter;
sometimes it consists of a most palpable tissue of lies; yet it is
greedily devoured by many a patient ear, because agreeable to the
majority of the audience. The report usually circulates that
Mehemed Ali is at war with the Turks in Syria, and carrying on
warfare at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> the same
time in Arabia, and is beaten everywhere; then it is generally
added, that the regiment quartered at Lobeid would receive orders
by the next dromedary to march to Egypt. This is, of course, most
pleasing intelligence to the Turkish officers, who are ardently
longing for a release, and is bruited about with innumerable
variations and additions. Then they talk about England, Germany,
Russia, and France, these being the only countries in Europe with
which the Turks are acquainted. In one or the other of these states
there is sure to be always war declared by the Grand Sultan,
because the sultan of the country which happens to form the topic
of conversation has failed to pay the tribute due to
Constantinople; for the majority of the Turks still uphold the
absurd opinion that these four countries are tributary to the Grand
Sultan of Constantinople. Thus the conversation turns upon these
political questions. If a sudden shower should happen to come on
when least expected; for the rain, as in all tropical countries,
generally falls in torrents, and, indeed, without the slightest
premonitory sign, so that it is difficult even to reach a place of
shelter, the confusion thus created would excite the most
hypochondriacal person to laughter. The mass of human beings who
stood, or sat, crowded together like a swarm of locusts, are in an
instant scattered in all directions. The screams of the women,
afraid of losing their goods in the crowd or of seeing them spoiled
by the rain; the cries of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_274">[274]</span> children who have lost their way, and are
in search of their parents; the alertness of the men, who like all
the rest dread the rain more than blows, and endeavour to escape as
quickly as they can, all tend to render the scene of confusion so
ludicrous, that the most stern spectator would be involuntarily
disposed to laugh. It is not the fear of ruining their garments
that induces them to scamper away so fast from the rain, for the
most of them have no clothes to spoil, and the Djelabi merely wear
a shirt, which the contact of a little pure water, moreover, could
not harm; and the Turks and foreigners who are entirely dressed
wear linen clothing, which water cannot injure; and yet they stand
in as much awe of every drop of rain as if burning sparks were
falling among them. They are impressed with the absurd idea that to
get once a little wet is sufficient to produce a fever. Their
apprehension is, strictly speaking, not so very erroneous, for the
slightest cold during the rainy season is sufficient to stretch the
most healthy man on a bed of sickness, from which it will be very
doubtful whether he recover.</p>

<p>High feasts and festivals create no variation in the ordinary
scene, as a general rule, and none of those fantasias<a id=
"FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
so common in Egypt are seen on Sundays and holidays at Lobeid; the
only amusement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> as
I have before observed, consists in the dances and songs of the
women and girls, after sunset, when every one returns to his
house.</p>

<p>In the quarter of the town named <em>Kongeri</em>, which is
inhabited by the men of Darfour, dwells the sheikh Sultan Tehme, a
descendant of the sultans of Darfour. His present occupation is
very ill-suited to his illustrious birth, for he is the mutilator
of those poor boys who subsequently serve as guards in the various
harems. This sheikh possesses two of the largest copper
kettle-drums I ever saw in my life; they were presented to him by
Mehemed Ali, as a mark of distinction. These drums are beaten all
day long on every Friday and festival; but their sound is by no
means very agreeable to those who are not over fond of music. This
sheikh presents a very imposing appearance, for though black as the
night, he has a very luxuriant beard, not very general among the
negroes, which he dies with a pomatum of a bright red colour; it
forms a striking contrast with his black shining face. When he
rides into the country his horse is preceded by two musicians
blowing during the whole march on a leathern pipe with eight
holes.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Lobeid I only found one single European
living, Dr. Iken, whom I have before mentioned, a native of
Hanover, who, like most of the Europeans, after a short residence
there paid his tribute to the climate. He is buried in the court of
his own house, which is situated in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_276">[276]</span> quarter or village of <em>Takarir</em>,
near the residence of the sultan Abumedina of Darfûr. The
government has appropriated his house to themselves, and converted
it into a magazine for leather. Seven other Europeans, besides Dr.
Iken, breathed their last at Lobeid, and are buried on the north
side of the hospital square. I planted a tree on each grave, and
had already fixed upon a place of rest near them. After I had
recovered from my dangerous illness in a slight measure, and was
just able to creep along with the assistance of a stick, my
favourite promenade was to those graves; they were the only relics
of Europeans I could find in that distant country, and I was under
the influence of a peculiar feeling when arriving at those
hillocks; I knew myself in the company of Europeans, although
departed from this world; I fancied myself in reality in their
presence, and I could have believed that they were listening with
sympathy to my soft complaints, heard my longing voice for my
distant fatherland, and were congratulating me on my recovery and
speedy departure from this country, so fatal to Europeans. When I
paid my last visit to this spot I was overpowered by that same
feeling we experience when parting with our friends.</p>

<p>Taking a summary view of Lobeid it appears only to be a large
village; the barren country around it presents a slightly excavated
surface, and the rain-water flowing towards the village forms a
torrent which runs towards the north, but soon
disappears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> in the
sand. The environs are cultivated with dockn. Lobeid offers many
spectacles rendering it interesting to the traveller, the chief of
which is the concourse of men from the most distant parts of
Africa, even from Timbuctoo, and other negro states as yet totally
unknown to Europeans. Before the first rays of the sun emerge from
the sea of desert sand, the whole of the population is on foot, and
each man begins the business of the day; with the majority,
however, this only consists in lying on the sand, or visiting his
neighbour when the same interesting occupation is performed in
company. The flocks are driven to their pasture by a shepherd
riding on his ox, the slaves are led to work with chains on their
feet, caravans are passing and repassing, and all this affords an
unique exhibition. In the streets songs are heard everywhere, even
the female slave at the Morak sings her plaintive ditty of
attachment to her home, whilst grinding the corn; in fact all is
life and motion as in a beehive; but from 11 o’clock <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> till 3 o’clock <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>,
during the hot months, quietude and silence reign in the streets,
and the whole town resembles a city of the dead; every one seeks
shelter from the fierce rays of a vertical sun in his own hut, and
there enjoys his rest, for it is impossible to exist out of the
shade; only a few hungry dogs may then be seen running about in the
streets, and even they do not remain long in the open air, but seek
a shady place with all speed, where they may protect themselves
from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> burning
heat. This recess lasts until 3 o’clock, when every one, refreshed
by his siesta, returns to his occupations. The streets now become
again as animated as they were at sunrise, but the most lively
scene is then in the market-place; this state of activity lasts
until the sun sets, when the inhabitants all retire again to their
houses to recover from the fatigues of the day. The streets become
suddenly empty, for with sunset night closes in; there is no
twilight, and every one is anxious for repose. This silence
continues until they have all finished their frugal meal, for the
poorest man finds the necessaries of life in his hut, or should he
really suffer want, goes to his nearest neighbour, where his wants
are willingly supplied. As soon as the repast is over, large fires
may be seen burning before the huts far and near; drums, beating of
hands, and songs resound in all directions, and the girls and young
men congregate for the merry dance, which is kept up until
midnight; and then the whole town once more becomes as suddenly
silent, for each man, with but few exceptions, betakes himself
again to rest. The streets are now, indeed, wrapped in the silence
of the grave, save that the stillness of the night is occasionally
interrupted by the howl of a hyaena, or the yelling of the timid
dogs. This mode of life is repeated daily, and but rarely undergoes
even the slightest variation.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span><a id=
"c15"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="med">COMMERCE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> monopoly enjoyed by the Egyptian
government in this province totally impedes trade in general. The
chief articles of commerce are not only all bought by the
authorities, who are, moreover, protected by a law prohibiting any
private person from bringing them into the market; but the immense
duties levied on the goods render it impossible to transport them
to Egypt; this rule especially applies to ivory. Every one is,
therefore, forced to sell to the government,—the most arbitrary
species of monopoly, or rather worse, inasmuch as the individual
suffers an outlay in capital, freight, and duty. The country might
produce indigo, opium, sugar, and many other articles, which would
yield an immense profit, both to private persons and to the
administration, for the soil requires but little cultivation, and
brings forth every plant in great luxuriance; but the onus placed
upon the province by the despotic government discourages the
individual from attempting more than trusting<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_280">[280]</span> entirely to nature. The whole population
live in fear, and are not one day sure of their property; thus
every one looks only to the moment, and troubles himself very
little about his successor. All the produce met with in commerce is
in its natural state, and few manufactured goods are ever seen
beyond some solitary cottons, and objects in leather.</p>

<p>The articles of export are: gum, hides, senna-leaves, ivory,
rhinoceros’-horns, cattle, tamarinds, ostrich-feathers,
ostrich-eggs, gold in rings and in grain, water-bags, salt,
tobacco, sim-sim, cisme, and slaves. The first three articles named
are the most lucrative in a commercial point of view, and
monopolized, of course, by the government. The gum Arabic is
collected in the forests a few months after the expiration of the
rainy season, and we may say by force; for the government pays the
cantaro of forty-four oock’ckahs, equivalent to one hundred and ten
pounds, with fifteen piasters (four shillings and fourpence) only.
They might greatly increase their profits if they were to
remunerate the labour better, and to pay more attention to this
branch of trade, although it must be allowed to a certain extent to
rest under the influence of the weather, for if much rain fall, the
trees are the more prolific; but the collection itself is performed
with the utmost carelessness, as the people employed are driven to
this work by force, and receive but small wages. Add to this, that
whole forests are being annually hewn down, and converted into
arable land, whilst no one<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_281">[281]</span> dreams of replanting trees, a provision
considered a work of supererogation, and left entirely to
nature.</p>

<p>If the export of gum and ivory to Europe should ever become a
free-trade, merely subjected to duty, these two articles will yield
a very considerable profit to those who may have the good fortune
to benefit first by this alteration, and who take the trouble to
repair to the spot. The gathering takes place, as I have
before-mentioned, at the close of the rainy season, in the months
of November, December, and January; the gum obtained is of the
finest quality, and is erroneously named gum Arabic. Kordofan
yields, in average years, from three thousand five hundred to four
thousand loads of this product, or from ten to fourteen thousand
hundred-weight, at forty-four oock’ckahs. I have been assured by
many persons that an addition of six thousand hundred-weight might
be made to this quantity, if the labour of the persons employed in
the collection were but better remunerated. Before the introduction
of the monopoly, it was sold in the following manner, a plan which
will be again pursued as soon as the present statutes are repealed.
A number of men, women, and children, gather the raw gum in the
forest into baskets, capable of containing twelve rottoli (the
rottolo about three quarters of a pound). Forty of these baskets
constitute a camel-load, which weighs four hundred and eighty
rottoli, and reckoning the tare of the cases at five<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> hundred rottoli; the cost of
this quantity would vary from five and a half to six Spanish
dollars. These five hundred rottoli<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> cannot be transported by
camel across the desert to Debba, on the Nile, because the load
would be too heavy; for three to four contari, at one hundred
rottoli, form the average load of each camel. Another expedient,
which might be turned to very good account, would be to pack the
gum in ox-hides instead of cases; for the government buys dry hides
at three piasters (ten pence halfpenny), and at Alexandria they are
sold at thirty piasters (six shillings and sixpence). It would be
imperatively necessary to employ the natives in the purchase of
gum, sending them out in all directions into the various villages;
but I would advise every one to be on his guard against the
Dongolavi, and it should be a rule in general not to trust any
native with much money, for it would stand a very good chance of
being totally lost. Those who are furnished with articles in
consumption in the country may effect one-third of their outlay in
goods, and will thus realize an average profit of fifty per
cent.</p>

<p>The place best adapted for the purchase of gum would be Bara,
and I adjoin a list of the expenses of freightage and duties thence
to Cairo, as defrayed before the introduction of the monopoly:—</p>

<p><span class="sc">As</span> the export duty is, according to the
existing laws, only twelve shillings, <i>ad valorem</i>, the
customs would amount only to sixteen shillings per hundred-weight
to Alexandria.</p>

<p>In the countries bordering on Kordofan, as Nuba, Takele, Kodero,
etc., the gum rots every year, because Mehemed Ali makes no use of
it, but is too avaricious to allow any other person to derive
benefit from it. The purchase might in those places be effected by
barter.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ivory.</span>—Many of the merchants at Trieste,
Marseilles, and Livorno, are even at the present day of the opinion
that the ivory imported, <i>viâ</i> the Cape of Good Hope, is found
in the East Indies, and have, therefore, given it the name of
Asiatic ivory; that, on the other hand, brought by way of Tripoli
and Alexandria, they have termed African ivory; whereas I can
assure them, that more than one-third, if not the half of the
former, is, properly speaking, African. During nineteen months of
my travels in the interior of Africa, I endeavoured to
collect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> accurate
information concerning this article of commerce, and I think that
my experience will prove of sufficient interest to entitle me to
give it at length. Mehemed Ali monopolizes the trade in ivory, and
thinks that he receives all the ivory imported into his states from
the centre of Africa; but he is very much mistaken in this respect,
for only that brought by the caravans from Darfour, which usually
reach Siut, in Upper Egypt, in the months of February and March, is
sold to the Viceroy, and this merely from necessity, in order to
enable the vendor to purchase other articles with the net proceeds.
In Kordofan, the very centre of the ivory trade, he has thrown the
trade open, but at the same time very cunningly calculated that it
must eventually come into his hands, for, after the djelabi
(merchants) have bought the ivory in Kordofan, and defrayed all the
expenses of its transport to Cairo, he is the first to make them an
offer for their stock, and, indeed, at so low a price that they can
hardly gain a small interest on the capital laid out; hence very
little ivory is brought to him now-a-days through that source.
Darfour, which receives ivory from its tributary provinces, Runga,
Kulla, Shala, Binga, Gimir, Sachana, Yambusa, Dama, etc., as
contribution, sells it in the country to the merchants of Kobbe and
El-Fasher. That which is collected at Pergu, Bachermi, Kugo, and
Niro, is annually forwarded to Tripoli. The market price at Kobbe
and El-Fasher, where large stores are always kept, is 3<em>l.</em>
2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_285">[285]</span> the cantaro of 12 rottoli (= 88 lbs). The
purchase is likewise effected by barter against cottons from
Dongola, or articles of trade from Germany, viz., double-edged
swords, red cloth, amber, glass-beads, spikenard, wire, etc. From
Darfour the ivory is brought to Lobeid, the capital of Kordofan,
and to Bara, a commercial town in the same province, but the
greater quantity passes through the country to the shores of the
Red Sea. In Kordofan, the cantaro costs already 10<em>l.</em>
18<em>s.</em>, including the duty. A great deal is brought from
Shabun and the Shilluk country to Kordofan, where the djelabi of
Lobeid and Bara become the possessors of it by barter; the Bakkara
(a nomadic tribe) also trade in ivory, and barter it away to the
djelabi above mentioned; to the Shilluks they give, at the most,
cottons from Dongola, glass beads, salt, and tobacco, in exchange
for it. All the ivory which passes through Kordofan, whether
directly or indirectly obtained, is forwarded to Suakim, a sea-port
on the Red Sea, under the 19° of northern latitude, where it is
received by Englishmen who have been quietly awaiting its arrival,
and have cast their net over sixteen hundred or two thousand miles
of the interior of Africa. The Englishman pays well and promptly,
hence he commands the market without any trouble; whilst for
Mehemed Ali remains only that which, for want of time, or owing to
some other circumstance, was not forwarded to Suakim. The English
have done all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> in
their power, for a long time, to keep secret the sources, whence
they derive so large a quantity of this commodity; thus they
remained perfectly quiet at Suakim, where this article of commerce
was brought to them, avoiding the necessity of exposing themselves
to the unhealthy climate of the interior of Africa, or rather of
Kordofan. They have appointed agents at Suakim, Indians by birth,
who manage the business for two, or at the most three, English
houses established in India. In the year 1840, an Englishman was
stationed there transacting business, and he was by no means
pleased at finding the secret, which had stood the test of so many
years, at last discovered. The cantaro costs from 10<em>l.</em> to
12<em>l.</em>, and scarcely a fourth part of it pays duty at the
customhouse in Suakim. Small coasting vessels act as lighters to
convey the cargo to the larger Arabian and Indian ships lying off
in readiness to receive it, which then sail for India directly.</p>

<p>At a distance of half a league from the shore of Abyssinia, and
two leagues from Arkiko, is an island in the possession of the
Viceroy of Egypt, named Massauwa, which forms, as it were, the key
of Abyssinia; for all the ivory brought from Abyssinia, the Galla
country, and the south-west and southern parts of Africa, must pass
through this island. The cargoes from Shoa (in southern Abyssinia)
and the neighbouring states, are discharged at Berbera and Zeila, a
town on the African<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
coast. From these few remarks, it may be easily deduced that the
ivory passing from Africa to India, and by the Cape, is not all
Asiatic, although a large share of it is certainly obtained in
India. In conclusion, I must observe that, when Mehemed Ali throws
the trade open, the first buyers in Kordofan will realize a very
handsome profit; but they should rather pay the cantaro of one
hundred and fourteen rottoli, with seven hundred and fifty piasters
at Lobeid, than venture into the country of the Shilluks, or to
Shabun, Runga, or Darfour, where they might certainly purchase it
at half the price, but would incur a risk which would decidedly
overbalance the advantage. It would be no less hazardous to send a
native of Kordofan into these countries to effect the purchase, for
they are such infamous liars, more especially the Dongolavi, that
they will rather allow themselves to be murdered than speak one
word of truth: the goods, moreover, or the money with which they
might be intrusted, would be certainly lost, as they will leave
their wives and children for so favourable an opportunity of
cheating.</p>

<p>The djelabi, would, in like manner, raise the price of the ivory
considerably, as soon as they had an idea that the demand for this
commodity increased; hence it would probably be the most judicious
plan to come to an understanding with a Turkish officer quartered
in Kordofan, and to effect the acquisition in his name; the
officers would willingly lend<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_288">[288]</span> themselves to this undertaking, without any
pretensions to a share in the profits, if they were only treated to
a few bottles of wine or good brandy; many honourable men are,
moreover, to be met with among the Turks, to whom the business
might fearlessly be intrusted. There would be no difficulty in
entering into Darfour or in reaching Kobbe, which is not the
capital, but merely the chief commercial town in the kingdom; nor
would it be impracticable to obtain ivory by purchase or barter
there, or, indeed, at El-Fasher, the capital, where large stores
are kept; but no one could answer for his return as long as Sultan
Mohammed Fadels is on the throne. Should the government ever
devolve upon his brother, Abumedina, Europeans would then have free
ingress and egress to the country, for he is favourably disposed
towards the Franks, and would willingly serve them. For this
assertion I can vouch, as I received the most unequivocal proofs of
the kindness of his disposition, at a time when my life was at
stake. The further expenses contingent upon this undertaking would
be as follows:—</p>

<p>It must be mentioned in giving this estimate, that the boat-hire
would vary according to the size of the vessel employed, nor can
the time of the journey by water be accurately calculated, as it
depends in a great measure on the wind and the height of the water
of the Nile. As a general rule three months and a half may be
reckoned as the time required to reach Alexandria from Lobeid in
travelling with goods.</p>

<p>Tamarinds are an article to which the government attaches no
value, it consequently permits the export. In the years 1837, 1838,
and 1839, when, from some cause unknown to me, the inflorescence
dropped off and no pods were formed, the rottolo cost on the spot
three-quarters of a penny; and this was at a time when the natives
were compelled to import tamarinds from Darfour, as the soil did
not produce the necessary quantity for the consumption of the
country. In other years, taking an average harvest, a camel load of
three cantari will sell at one<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_290">[290]</span> pound, The duty on this article is
trifling. I found the flowers taken in the form of tea, a very
excellent remedy, and am only astonished that this wholesome
beverage is not in more general use in Europe. Ostrich feathers may
be reckoned among the most profitable articles of commerce, when in
demand in Europe. The inhabitants of Caccie, a town on the borders
of Darfour, and of Haraza, and many other villages, occupy
themselves with the capture of these birds. An ostrich’s skin
yields usually about three rottoli of black feathers, and half a
rottolo of white plumes. Several sorts are parted off for sale,
<i>e. g.</i>: two-thirds blacks, one-third whites, at 10<em>s</em>
6<em>d</em> to 13<em>s</em> 6<em>d</em> the rottolo; greys at
5<em>s</em> 3<em>d</em>; blacks at 2½ to 3 piasters; white plumes,
not of the best quality, from 2<em>l</em> 2<em>s</em> to
2<em>l</em> 12<em>s</em>. The duty on the feathers is one pound on
the value in Kordofan, Darauve, and Cairo. They are made up into
small packages enclosed in the skin of the bird; but great
attention is required in the packing, for it is almost incredible
how the moth attacks these goods, it is, therefore, indispensably
necessary to air the feathers occasionally, and to pepper them in
the packing.</p>

<p>The government purchases all the oxhides and consigns them to
Egypt; it pays three piasters for each hide. There are no
calf-skins in commerce, as it is contrary to the koran to slaughter
calves. Sheep and goat skins for water-bags (Ckirbeh) constitute an
article of export trade; these water-bags are also manufactured
from ox leather, two of them generally form a camel load. Salt and
tobacco are articles<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_291">[291]</span> of export to the Shilluks and Yaenky, and
are considered favourable objects for barter.</p>

<p>Sim-sim, whence an oil is expressed, is exported to Sennaar;
Cisme,<a id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class=
"fnanchor">[71]</a> which grows in Kordofan, although that of a
superior quality comes from Takele, is exported to Egypt and the
Levant. The price is very low; about twenty paras (two-pence) the
rottolo, the same quantity is, however, paid in Cairo with four
piasters (one shilling). It is used as a remedy in diseases of the
eye, but great caution is necessary in purchasing this article; and
it should indeed be always subjected to close examination, for
there are several varieties in commerce, the fine grained specimens
being the best, and the coarse grained the inferior varieties.</p>

<p>Gold is a very important article of export, but not very
profitable at present, since the price has risen considerably. I am
told that the oock’ckah was sold at two hundred piasters before the
Turks entered the country; whereas the same quantity now costs
three hundred and seventy or four hundred piasters; at this price,
from ten to fifteen per cent. may be realized; the oock’ckah of
Kordofan is rather heavier than that of Sennaar. Gold is met with
in commerce, in rings varying in size, and also in grains; the
latter variety is enclosed in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_292">[292]</span> quills of large birds of prey, and is
generally preferred to that in rings, which the natives have
already began to adulterate. The greatest quantity of this metal is
brought from the neighbourhood of Shabun, and from other southern
provinces.</p>

<p>Horned cattle forms one of the chief exports, and is transported
by the government to Egypt in large droves, of which more than the
half perish on the road from want of proper care. Private
individuals cannot engage in this speculation, for it would be
injudicious to transport large herds, like those of the government,
because attended with enormous expense, as it would require
magazines to be erected at each day’s march between Debba and
Cairo. Smaller droves are forwarded to Sennaar and Dongola by
private parties. The government have even given up their large
transports to Cairo. Camels are also exported to Cairo, because the
price of these animals is very low in Kordofan.</p>

<p>The chief trade, before all the articles enumerated, is,
unfortunately, in slaves. The government and the Djelabi emulate
each other in doing all in their power to gain possession of these
unhappy beings by every possible method. The former, who are
wholesale dealers, resort to the most cruel practices to seize upon
slaves in large bodies;<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> whilst the Djelabi imitate
them on a smaller scale, and consider every species of cunning and
deception fair, where the object is to gain possession of these
poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span> wretches. The
slaves of the Djelabi, however, are always treated with more
forbearance than those of the government, who are not very
particular about losing several hundred of their unfortunate
victims by positive ill-treatment, or no less blameable neglect;
whereas the Djelabi are compelled to use them more leniently, as
the death of each slave entails the loss of a small capital. Lobeid
is the centre of the slave trade, and market is, consequently, held
there daily. To this place slaves are brought, not only from the
neighbouring countries, but even from Kulla, Banda, Wuanga,
Bachermi, Bergu, Pegu, and more distant states, but not in such
large numbers as from the borders. It is absolutely revolting to
hear how these poor creatures have oftentimes fallen into
captivity, and it would be, indeed, incredible were not the
opportunity for conviction of the truth of so frequent occurrence.
The Djelabi proceed into the neighbouring countries with goods,
which they barter away for slaves who have become prisoners of war
or captives by stealth. They stand in connexion with a species of
kidnappers, who think very little of stealing the children of their
own countrymen for a trifle, and bringing them to a preconcerted
spot for barter. The greater part of those bought up by the Djelabi
are thus collected by the marauding Bakkara. The price of these
unhappy beings varies according to their age, health, and beauty,
as also according to the country they may call their fatherland.
Children born in Kordofan<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_294">[294]</span> of captive parents are generally of the
highest price, because already accustomed to some species of work
and more especially because acquainted with the Arabic language,
for the owner of a married slave, or of a girl who brings a child
into the world, is at the same time proprietor of the latter, and
is permitted to sell it; masters even who have children by their
female slaves may dispose of their offspring, and examples of this
unnatural proceeding are by no means uncommon. In short whatever is
considered most cruel and revolting by all civilized nations, is
treated with the utmost levity in this country, so that it is,
indeed, impossible to find words to give full vent to your feelings
of indignation and horror.</p>

<p>The human being, deprived of his liberty, is here regarded as a
commodity, or ready money, passes from hand to hand as in
circulation or in commerce, and must think himself fortunate if he
ultimately chance to become the denizen of a house where he may
find rest for the sole of his foot, or may reckon on the treatment
due to him as a portion of humanity. No single house is to be found
among the more opulent part of the community which is not provided
at least with one slave, either male or female, for the performance
of the menial offices, for it is, as it were, <i>comme il faut</i>
to fill the house with captives, and to keep a separate slave
appropriated to each separate office. The greater number, however,
is hence exported, in larger or smaller convoys, to Egypt and the
Levant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_295">[295]</span><em>Senna-leaves</em> are found in many
parts of Kordofan in abundance, but the government makes no use of
them, and others are prevented from turning them to advantage by
the existing monopoly. They are equal in quality to those of
Dongola, which the administration thence imports and sells under
the denomination of Alexandrian or Egyptian Senna. Not the fiftieth
part of these leaves, however, are natives of Egypt, for they are
first met with at Assuan, and are erroneously called Egyptian
leaves; their true native country is the province of Dongola. The
government draws its entire supply from that province. The
inhabitants of the deserts in those parts collect them, and receive
from two hundred to four hundred piasters, according to the state
of the market, for the camel-load of three cantari, at forty-four
oock’ckahs, delivered in New Dongola. As the government would have
to pay an addition of sixty to eighty piasters on the freight of
each camel-load they might draw from Kordofan, they naturally do
not obtain any leaves from that province, and they are left to rot
unused.</p>

<p>These are then the chief articles produced in the country, or
received transito from the bordering states.</p>

<p>The importation of articles for home consumption, or for trade
with other countries, is effected by caravans, the majority of
which arrive from Cairo, a far less number comes from Sennaar, and
yet less from Suakim; they return laden with a few
inconsiderable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
objects from Araby and India to Lobeid and Bara. Commerce is
carried on in a very dilatory manner, and the return of profits is
attended with a considerable loss of time. In the month of Ramadan,
the great Turkish fast, the most home-business is transacted.
During the rainy season all communication with other countries is
cut off, and it is a rare occurrence if a small caravan ever arrive
during that period, for every merchant is justly under the
apprehension of a loss, by the damage his goods might sustain from
the heavy showers; and the streams are, moreover, so overflowing
that frequently many days transpire before a caravan can cross
them. The immense journey of three or four months duration, and the
freightage by camel and boat, render the price of all imported
articles very high in Kordofan. This outlay would, however, be but
of slight importance in a commercial point of view, were it not for
the exorbitant duty, which so materially augments the price of the
goods; such absurdity and despotism could, in fact, only exist
under the government of Mehemed Ali; even if his realms were to
extend to the assumed range of mountains of the moon, the
merchandize would have to pay customs in each province it might
pass through before reaching the place of its destination. All
goods on their arrival at Alexandria are subjected to a moderate
import duty, which, however, only franks them to Cairo. The same
goods shipped in Old Cairo to be conveyed up the Nile
must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> again pay as
follows: in Old Cairo on an average twelve shillings, in Dongola
thirty piasters per camel-load, in Lobeid three hundred piasters
for a load of cottons, whether fine or of inferior quality, without
distinction. A camel-load of rice pays one hundred and fifty
piasters, wine one hundred piasters, brandy, rosoglio, and rum
fifty shillings ad valorem. The states of Austria furnish the
greater quantity of articles for Kordofan, the majority of which
are again exported into the negro states. England yields only white
calicos; common Bohemian linen was formerly imported, but the more
reasonable prices of cottons have quite ousted it from the market.
The following are the articles of import trade to Kordofan: cloves,
pepper, sugar, coffee, sulphur, rice, soap, chintz and cotton
prints, red and blue sackcloth, linen from Cairo (named here
<em>shouter melanie</em>), ready-made clothes for Turks, red shoes,
wine, brandy, rosoglio, vinegar, oil, green olives, cheese, amber
from Prussia (Nos. 3 to 6), opaque coral, and a few other
inconsiderable objects. The imports from the Austrian dominions are
the following: spikenard,<a id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> shot, dogas,<a id=
"FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>

looking-glasses in paper cases, finger-rings set with stones, glass
beads of every colour,<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>—that of lapis lazuli, is
the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
fashionable in Kordofan,—card-counters.<a id=
"FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
The sale of glass will increase considerably in time, the whole sum
expended in this commodity at Cairo does not at present amount to
more than twenty-five pounds at the utmost. The Levantine articles
are in chief request, such as narghilé,<a id=
"FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
brick,<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class=
"fnanchor">[84]</a> mastrapà,<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> syringes, and common
tumblers. From Venice the natives obtain glass beads, and paper
dressed in the Turkish fashion. Austrian manufactures finding so
ready a market in a large portion of Africa and Asia, and Cairo
being the most suitable depot, it is very astonishing that only two
Austrian commercial houses should be established in that town: the
one is a Bohemian house for the sale of glass beads and
looking-glasses, the other a Venetian for the sale of Venetian
beads. The Austrian trade thus suffers a great loss, for the
Asiatic and African merchant is forced to purchase the imperial
produce after it has passed through many hands, and as each agent
must make at least a small profit, it is evident that the price of
the articles is in this manner considerably raised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>All these goods
pass through Cairo, but few of them by way of Suakim and Sennaar. I
was the first Austrian subject who made an attempt to traffic with
this country, I had not the idea of establishing myself, for my
capital was too inconsiderable for that purpose, and, in fact, only
intended to defray the expenses of my journey, but I believe that
the experience I made may be of great service to others. I caution
every one, however, who may intend visiting this country with goods
to be on his guard against the white ants, and never to neglect
placing his cases on stones, for I have myself unfortunately been a
sufferer by the ubiquity of these destructive beasts. During my
illness I was incapable of looking after my luggage, and as a
consequence found, on my recovery, all my cottons in a perfectly
unsaleable state, and this when on my flight at a time when I had
moneys to reclaim. The Termites became the cause why I was
compelled to return without a servant, and to march during two days
on foot through the Desert of Krusko. The prices of goods vary with
the seasons; thus, during the rains, when no caravan can arrive
from Egypt, and goods are consequently scarce, the prices increase
by fifty shillings of their usual cost.</p>

<p><em>Coffee</em> is imported from Abyssinia, and the ordinary
price of the rottolo is three piasters; but in the year 1838, it
rose to eighteen piasters (5<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em>). During the
rainy season sugar stood at nine piasters<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_301">[301]</span> per rottolo (1lb. English); rice at twelve
piasters per oock’ckah; vinegar at fifteen piasters the bottle:
soap at nine piasters the rottolo; pepper at twelve piasters; the
prices of all goods, however fall with the arrival of fresh
supplies. Many of the articles of importation are bought up by
Djelabi, who trade with the interior of the country, and barter
them away for slaves and other commodity. The commerce with the
interior even requires some experience, <i>e. g.</i> in respect to
glass-beads; for, on some of the hills, the white specimens are in
request; on others the red or blue beads are preferred, and the
same rule applies to many other articles. A great deal of salt and
tobacco is imported into the country of the Shilluks. The Djelabi,
in whose hands the entire trade may be said to rest, might turn it
to far better advantage, if they had more talent for business, and
were less careless in its transaction. Thus they pay no attention
to the demands of the market, but purchase, year after year, the
same articles, sit themselves down in a sook, and will not quit
that spot in quest of fresh supplies until they have sold the very
last article, be it ever so trifling. The value of time is totally
unknown to them, and as for leaving the remainder of their unsold
goods with an agent on commission, a son would not trust his own
father, but rather lose the most valuable time for travelling for
two or three pounds of soap, and a few trumpery glass-beads. These
Djelabi are Dongolavi, and have remained true to the character of
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> original
parents in Dongola. They will rather allow their goods to spoil
than part with them below their standard; they sell one article at
the same rate as one hundred articles, and make very little
difference in price as regards quality; for common or damaged
cottons, rusty or intact wire, are all sold at the same price. The
merchandize which is not damaged on the road is spoiled in the
market-place, where everything is thrown down on the sand in one
large heap, and no one troubles himself whether a person in the
crowd walk over his goods with dirty feet, or a shower drench them
thoroughly. He who first comes selects the best articles, and he
who is forced to wait until the greater part is disposed of, takes
whatever he may happen to lay his hands on, pays the same price, or
sometimes even more, considering the scarcity, but walks away
equally contented.</p>

<p>I have convinced myself that the very commonest goods only
should be brought to this market, for every man may form an opinion
of the manner of transacting business, and of the mode in which the
merchandize is treated. I am certain that an European, accustomed
to the climate at an early age, and acquainted with the demands of
the country, who might establish a commercial-house at Lobeid, and
carry on his business with moderate caution, would realize a
handsome fortune. But, as I have before said, an European would
meet with difficulties, and irksome trials in this undertaking,
unknown to the natives. The time for engaging in a speculation
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> this description
is now at hand, for Mehemed Ali is about to throw the trade
open.</p>

<p>The currency of the country is that of Egypt, a piaster being
equal to three-pence-halfpenny English. The Maria Theresia dollar,
column-dollars, and five franc pieces, of which there are three
varieties, are taken at an estimate of twenty piasters each,
although they virtually differ in value. The dollars, however, when
in request for purchases in Darfour, are paid with twenty-two,
twenty-three, and even twenty-four piasters; in examining them, the
natives do not look to the seven points in the clasp, or the nine
points in the diadem, nor to the letters “S. F.” as is the case in
Abyssinia. No copper circulates, and very few silver piasters, so
that, indeed, in purchasing single piasters, one piaster,
<i>agio</i>, is paid for nine pieces. In addition to this coin,
there is a small coin of iron, named <em>hashias</em>, in
circulation, struck during the reign of the sultan of Darfûr, which
has continued in currency since that period: it is a small piece of
iron, from two to three inches in length, and of the form of an
obtuse bibrachial anchor. 150 of these pieces were formerly
considered equivalent to one dollar; they subsequently fell in
value to 250, and their present currency is 800 to the dollar, or
one <em>para</em> each. The weight is the same as in Egypt, viz. 1
cantaro, equal to 100, or to 112 rottoli, or to forty-four
oock’ckah’s. The rottolo is = 144 oz., the oock’ckah equal to 400
dir’hems. Forty-four oock’ckahs constitute about one
hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> weight. The
measure for corn is the ardeb of twenty-four <em>mith</em>, two
ardebs are equivalent to three stajo of Trieste.</p>

<p>Common cottons will pass from hand to hand as currency, and in
small dealings half a gourd of dockn, or two handfulls may be
substituted for cash. The yard-measure in use among the natives, is
the distance from the elbow to the index-finger, adding four finger
breadths.</p>

<span class="med">MEHEMED ALI’S SLAVE-HUNTS IN GENERAL.<a id=
"FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class=
"fnanchor">[86]</a></span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Many</span> travellers who have visited the
East, and more especially Egypt, justly mention the humanity with
which slaves are treated in these countries, but few persons are
probably acquainted with the inhuman manner in which these
miserable beings are led into captivity. The treatment they meet
with among the Turks, Arabs, and other eastern nations, certainly
is an indemnification, although a very frail one, for the loss of
their liberty; but unfortunately only a small number of these poor
wretches live to enjoy even this slight benefit, for more than
one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> half of them
fall victims to barbarous and cruel treatment before they reach the
place of their destination. The Viceroy of Egypt institutes
annually, once or twice in the course of the year, an actual hunt
in the mountains of Nuba, and in the bordering countries, and
seizes upon a certain number of the negroes by stratagem or force,
in order either to pay the arrears due to his troops in Kordofan
with these unfortunate men, instead of with ready money, or to
increase his revenue by the sale of his fellow creatures. I must
leave it to the kind judgment of my readers whether an apology for
such a proceeding is to be found, and abstain myself from any
observation on the subject, as the object of my sketch is simply to
give a correct description of the slave-hunts as conducted by
Mehemed Ali. Several European journals have stated that these
marauding expeditions were put an end to by command of the viceroy
on the occasion of his visit to Sennaar, but I can assure the
reader that the order was “<i>vox et præterea nihil</i>,” and that
these robberies take place as before even at the present day. No
pen can describe the acts of deliberate cruelty perpetrated on
these occasions, revolting atrocities which I am sure that Mehemed
Ali, were he acquainted with the particulars, would visit on the
heads of his officers, notwithstanding that they are committed in
his interest and in his service; unfortunately, however, the
distance of this ill-fated province is too great from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> seat of justice
for the cries of the afflicted to reach his ear, and those whose
duty it would be to report these inhuman deeds, are too deeply
criminated themselves. The burden of this sanguinary fate falls
most heavily upon the miserable inhabitants of the Nuba mountains.
In the year 1825, four years, therefore, after the conquest, the
number of slaves which had been led away into captivity was
estimated at forty thousand; and in the year 1839 the total number
amounted at least to two hundred thousand, without reckoning the
thousands stolen by the Bakkara and bought by the Djelabi. As soon
as the rainy season is concluded, the arrangements for the
marauding excursion called gasua<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> are made, and the
necessary number of camels are pressed into service. Of the
multitude of animals required an estimate may be formed, by
considering that every infantry soldier is provided with a camel to
mount, and that their total amount is nearly doubled by those
employed in the transport of arms, ammunition, tents, and other
military stores. The outfit of the expedition causes the commanding
officer, however, not the least care, for everything being
considered in the countries subject to Egypt as property of the
government, he experiences very little trouble in obtaining his
supplies. The soldiers steal whatever they can find, and thus in a
few days the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
necessary articles are furnished. To provisions very little
attention is paid, for the harvest terminates with the rainy
season, and the soldiers well know by many years experience where
to find the supplies of the poor negroes, gained absolutely by the
sweat of their brow, but vainly hidden from the rapacious hands of
these avaricious barbarians. The province of Dar Hammer is more
especially oppressed for the purpose of obtaining camels; but as
the majority consists of young animals which have never borne a
weight upon their backs, and must therefore be taught to bend to
receive their load or for the convenience of their rider, each
soldier is provided with his camel ten to fourteen days before the
march, during which interval they are daily exercised in the
morning and afternoon. It is really a very imposing sight to behold
these hundreds of camels collected together on one spot, where the
obstinate animals are being broken in to kneel down. A well-taught
camel always exhibits evident signs of displeasure and utters a
piercing cry whenever it bends down; imagine therefore in addition,
an immense number of wild unbroken beasts who are frequently
obliged to be pulled down on their knees by ropes, and you will be
able to form a slight idea of the exercising ground. It frequently
happens that a clumsy rider is thrown in mounting, or rather as the
animal rises, and receives a severe injury. But even on this
occasion we have proof that the animal must succumb to the will of
man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span> for in the
course of a few days the same beasts we had seen so refractory and
dull before, obey their riders at a mere wink. The complement of
the brigade employed in a slave-hunt consists ordinarily of from
one thousand to two thousand men regular troops of infantry; from
four hundred to eight hundred Mogghrebeen armed with guns and
pistols; from three hundred to one thousand native troops on foot,
with shields and spears, each man carrying from three to five
javelins in a small leathern quiver attached to his shoulder by a
cord; and from three hundred to five hundred natives mounted on
dromedaries, armed with shield and spear. The dromedary riders
present a very military appearance; they are quite naked, with the
exception of a small piece of calico round their loins, and exhibit
an alacrity which is almost incredible; they also exercise for a
certain time before the march, and their shouts in a charge, which
is always made in a body and at the full speed of the dromedary,
the whistling of their lances in the air, whilst their shaggy locks
float in the wind, and the oblong shields covering their entire
bodies, give the riders a very fearful appearance, sufficient to
overawe the most courageous man. I was always present at their
manœuvres, and can assure my readers, that it took a long time
before I accustomed myself to the sight of these men without
feeling a secret horror, although I lived among them, and had
absolutely nothing to fear. At these moments<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_310">[310]</span> these people appear as if deranged, and
it is very difficult to recognise those with whom you may be well
acquainted, they so distort their features in their shout.</p>

<p>As soon as the preparations are concluded, the expedition sets
out upon its march. Two to four field-pieces accompany it, and it
is provided with a sufficient supply of bread for eight days. The
oxen, sheep, and other beasts for slaughter, which may be required,
are seized on in Kordofan, although the province may have already
paid its contribution. If they meet a herd at pasture or at a well,
the cattle is stolen; no one asks whether it belong to one person
or to several, the contribution is not effected in shares; whoever
meets with the loss must bear it with patience; no objection, no
remonstrance is of avail; no complaint is ever listened to, for the
governor is present in person.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the forces at the nearest hills of the Nubas,
the natives are challenged to contribute a stipulated number of
slaves. This demand is generally acceded to willingly, because the
poor creatures know they are too close to the confines of Kordofan,
and that they would expose themselves to a far more obdurate fate
if they offered resistance. If then the slaves are voluntarily
contributed, that hill is spared. But about this time a scarcity of
bread generally begins to be felt; the troops, therefore, are not
content with slaves alone but must be provided with grain, nor do
they ever for one moment<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_311">[311]</span> consider whether the harvest has been
successful, or the reverse with these poor people; but whatever
their wants may be, they must be supplied either spontaneously, or
by force; and on these occasions the soldiers show vast experience
in detecting the hidden stores of the unfortunate natives, whom
they frequently leave barely enough bread for the ensuing day. The
march is now continued to the next hill. The skirmishers already
consider themselves on hostile ground, and they halt in the
vicinity of that hill they intend to storm on the next day, or if
time admit it, on that very day. Before the actual charge takes
place, they endeavour to arrange the affair amicably, and dispatch
a herald to the sheikh of the hill, commanding him to descend into
camp, and bring the number of slaves ordered by the commanding
officer with him. If he have already come to an understanding with
his subjects, or feel his inequality to the Turkish troops, and
will not offer resistance, the stipulated number of slaves is
furnished, and the claim is thus cancelled, in order to avoid
unnecessary bloodshed. Then comes the conscription. The slaves are
generally volunteers, who sacrifice themselves, or who to free
their brethren from a hard fate subject themselves to a yet more
painful lot. Scenes may at these times be witnessed that would rend
the heart of a man of feeling. Who is ever willing to quit his
home, to separate himself for ever from his parents, his
blood-relations, and friends? who leaves the roof willingly that
has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> covered him
from the day of his birth, under which he has passed happy hours in
the circle of those that are dear to him? Who can boldly face a
frightful future, entailing permanent captivity, promising nothing
but misery, cruel treatment, and, what becomes even desirable,
pallid death? Yet the necessity is there—some one must be
victimized, some one must volunteer to sacrifice his liberty; and
for this privilege the father will contend with the son, and the
brother with the brother, for each man is anxious to save the other
at the expense of his own life. Overpowering, indeed, must be the
knowledge that they are about to fall into the hands of the
heartless Turks, where nothing but misery and torture awaits them,
to which they must ultimately succumb; but yet more heart-rending
must be the feeling of leaving all that is nearest and dearest to
them, for ever; this must be wretchedness, indeed. In sorrow and
tears they part—press the last kiss on the cheek of their
relations, and descend into the camp of their heartless and
ruthless tormentors; nay, they are even frequently torn by force
from the arms of their friends. The sheikh generally receives a
present of a dress in remuneration for the readiness with which he
has performed his services. Very few hills, however, submit to the
voice of power thus tacitly on a mere challenge; for the majority
of the villages, advantageously situated on steep declivities or
inaccessible heights, and only to be scaled with the utmost
difficulty, defend themselves most sturdily, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span> fight for their liberty with a
courage, perseverance, and resolution equalled by few instances we
find recorded in history. A very small portion of the negroes only
fly before the approach of their persecutors, although they might
save themselves with all their property, by a retreat into the
neighbouring hills, for they always receive timely intimation of
the advance of the enemy; but they look upon escape by flight as
disgraceful, and prefer death in the struggle for their freedom.
If, therefore, the sheikh will not listen to the claim made upon
him, the village must stand a storm. The cavalry and lance-bearers
surround the whole hill, whilst the infantry endeavour to scale the
heights. In former days, the villages and places where the negroes
were congregated together, were cannonaded, but with the
inefficiency of the Egyptian artillery scarcely one shot ever took
effect; and thus the negroes paid no attention to this prelude, but
it appeared on the contrary rather to encourage them to a more
obstinate resistance.</p>

<p>The roaring of the cannon certainly caused them at first more
alarm than the effect, but they subsequently became accustomed to
the noise, and totally disregarded it. Every access to the hill is
barricaded with stones and other impediments, and the village
supplied with water for two days, for few hills can boast of
springs, the water, therefore, must be fetched from the foot of the
hill. All the cattle and other property is carried up
into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> the fortified
height, in short, every arrangement is made for an obstinate
defence. The men, armed with spears, occupy every point of
importance, while the women even do not remain idle spectators, but
either participate in the fight, or encourage their husbands by
their lamentations and war-cry, and hand them their arms; in fact,
every one is in activity except the aged and infirm. The points of
their wooden arrows are dipped into poison which stands in an
earthen vessel beside them. It is the juice of a plant, and appears
white like curdled milk, but of what plant it may be the juice I
could never learn, for this is a secret imparted only to a few
persons in the village. I am told that there are many hills where
this secret is totally unknown. As soon as the officer gives the
word of command to attack, the infantry beat to arms and storm the
hill. Thousands of spears, large stones, and immense beams of wood
are instantly hurled at the storming party, every stone is an
ambush to a wary negro, who either throws his poisoned dart at the
enemy, or, waiting his opportunity, thrusts his spear into the body
of his unsuspecting foe on his approach. The soldiers, who
experience the greatest difficulty in scaling the steep
acclivities, are obliged to sling their muskets to their backs to
facilitate their ascent with their hands, and frequently fall
victims before they have even seen the enemy. But nothing deters
these marauders when bent on prey, goaded on by cupidity and the
desire of revenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
they heed no impediment, not even death itself; over the dead body
of his fallen comrade the successor marches with impetuosity, his
mind totally engrossed by ideas of plunder and murder; and thus the
village is at last captured in spite of the most resolute defence.
But now, indeed, is vengeance terrific: neither aged men nor the
infirm, neither helpless women and children, nor, indeed, the babe
unborn are spared; every hut is plundered, the property of the
unfortunate besieged either pillaged or destroyed, and whosoever
falls into the hands of the destroyer with his life is carried down
into the camp as captive. When the negroes see that resistance is
no longer of avail, they frequently prefer suicide, unless
prevented, to slavery; and thus it often occurs that a father rips
up the abdomen of his wife, then of his children, and lastly
murders himself, to avoid falling alive into the hands of the
enemy. Others endeavour to escape captivity by secreting themselves
in caverns, where they pass many days without food; they there lie
upon their backs, and will remain in this position sometimes for an
entire week. I have been informed that a man can very well bear the
whole of the eight days without nourishment, if he have only
surmounted the difficulty of the first three days. But even in this
covert they are not safe, as the monsters either hunt them up or
destroy them in their places of refuge; for the soldiers light
fires with pitch, sulphur,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_316">[316]</span> and other combustibles before the entrance,
and endeavour to drive the irritating fumes into the caves, when
the poor wretches are forced to creep out and deliver themselves to
their enemies, or perish by suffocation in the smoke. After every
means have been resorted to for gaining possession of the living,
the unfortunate beings are escorted to the camp, the houses are
plundered, and the cattle is driven away, and a detachment of
several hundred soldiers then examines the hill in every direction
to pillage the hidden grain, in order that the survivors who may
have been fortunate enough to save their lives by flight, or by
secreting themselves in inaccessible caverns, may not find anything
on their return wherewith to maintain their dearly purchased
existence.</p>

<p>The experience of many years has made the troops employed in
these expeditions gradually wiser; in former times one-third of the
number at least, and on some occasions even one half of them lost
their lives in these attacks, at present they confine themselves to
a simple blockade, and storm merely in extreme cases. Very few
hills are, as I before said, provided with springs, when,
therefore, all communication is impeded, the poor negroes are
forced to surrender, but not before they have suffered the most
horrible tortures; for they never provide themselves with a supply
of water for longer than two days, partly from want of vessels or
reservoirs, partly because they<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_317">[317]</span> do not expect to be besieged for a longer
period, thus the scarcity of water is generally felt on the third
day of the blockade. Nothing can be more frightful than the
position of these unhappy men at this time. The fear of falling
into the hands of the Turks on the one hand, and the certainty of
death from thirst on the other, drives the poor wretches to the
very verge of despair. This scarcity is immediately known in camp,
for the screams of the children and the groans of the cattle betray
the melancholy position of the village. The cattle runs about as if
wild, and on the third day becomes so dangerous that the negroes
are obliged to slay it. The human being struggles in despair with
death, to find a mode of escape, but, alas! in vain: the
blood-thirsty huntsmen have surrounded their game too securely,
thus not one soul can escape with his life. Many of the unhappy
victims prefer death for themselves and their families to
captivity, whilst others endeavour to conceal themselves in
caverns, and thus to spare themselves the awful miseries of
slavery. The remainder call a meeting to concert upon the surrender
of their village and their children. The calamity makes not the
slightest impression upon their persecutors, who remain quiet
beholders of all these horrors, impatiently awaiting the moment
when they shall receive their victims. The scarcity of water does
not apply to all the hills without exception, for several of them
are well supplied with water, and are not<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_318">[318]</span> so easily to be taken. In such cases force
becomes necessary, but it frequently happens that populous villages
or such as are favoured by the ground, are able to repel the
storming party several times with considerable carnage, so that the
expedition frequently will not venture on an attack for fear of
heavy losses, as was the case with Mount “Deyer,”<a id=
"FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
situated at a distance of two day’s march from Lobeid, which was
thrice attacked without success, and where the troops suffered
severely. But even in such cases they know how to ensure the
certain fall of their victims by demoniacal deceit. Thus, after
Kurshid Pasha, governor of the Belled-Soodan, had made several
fruitless attempts at storming a hill in the country of the
Shilluks, in which he had been, moreover, always repulsed with
considerable carnage, and at last had made up his mind that every
further attack would be in vain, and his loss too frightful, he
thought of the following <em>ruse</em>, which would never have
succeeded with any other people than this good-natured tribe; in
this case, however, it proved successful. He encamped himself,
namely, at the foot of the hill, without surrounding it, where he
quietly remained for several days; he then despatched one of his
soldiers into the village with the request to the inhabitants to
send down four hundred dishes of food to his people in camp, and
assured them at the same time that they need be under no further
apprehension about him,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_319">[319]</span> as he would not make another attack on
their village, but would march his troops off immediately on
receipt of the provisions. The good-natured negroes, suspecting no
harm, forgot all animosity towards their enemy in consideration of
their pretended unfortunate position, and instantly shewed their
readiness to accede to the request, by furnishing the provisions
required. The articles of food were duly prepared, and four hundred
grown persons carried the number of dishes demanded down into the
camp of their persecutors. <span class="sc">How</span> were they,
however, now deceived! for no sooner had they placed the dishes on
the ground at the order of Kurshid-Pasha, than they were, on a
signal he gave, surrounded on all sides and made prisoners, without
the necessity of pulling a trigger, or without the possibility of
their offering resistance.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of those hills which may have been forced into a
surrender by cutting off their supplies, and more especially by
depriving them of water, are compelled to deliver themselves up as
captives in the camp, as soon as they have capitulated; but the
condition of those who have defended themselves, or stood the
blockade for some time, is far more dreadful. Worn out with the
fatigues of the conflict, or totally exhausted by the want of
water, they can scarcely stand, and are literally speaking, dragged
down into camp, where they are certainly regaled with the absolute
necessaries of life, but are allowed only a short time
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> recover
themselves. The Turks have, indeed, sufficient compassion to send
the necessary quantity of water up to those poor wretches on the
hill, who are too weak even to be brought down; they are obliged to
pour water over their heads first, and to allow them to drink only
in small quantities, and gradually, for indulgence would prove
fatal to them.</p>

<p>The greatest sufferings are not yet surmounted, and many of
these unhappy men would prefer death inflicted by their own hands
to the dreadful fate which awaits them, if they were acquainted
with their lot beforehand. They now have to suffer every
description of ill-treatment from their tormentors; blows with the
butt-end of the musket, bayonet wounds, and stripes with the whip,
are the ordinary modes of encouragement adopted to arouse the
energies of those miserable beings, who, exhausted by physical or
moral suffering, may happen to sink. Pity is unheard of in these
transports; and as personal interest is not engaged for the
preservation of one of those unhappy wretches, or to prove it an
advantage, the only consideration is to render their escape
impossible. The Djelabi treat their slaves with more humanity,
because their personal interests are implicated, for each slave may
be considered a capital to them, and they, consequently, do all in
their power to preserve life, at least, and thus to avert a loss.
The Turks, on the other hand, who have no considerations of this
description to attend to, treat<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_321">[321]</span> their prisoners far worse than they would
beasts. As soon as they have collected from three to six hundred,
or perhaps a thousand slaves, the convoy is sent with an escort of
native troops, and of about fifty men, regulars, under the command
of an officer to Lobeid.</p>

<p>To prevent flight, a <em>Sheba</em> is hung round the neck of
the full-grown slaves; it consists of a young tree about six or
eight feet in length, and two inches in thickness, forming a fork
in front; this is bound round the neck of the victim so that the
stem of the tree presents anteriorly, the fork is closed at the
back of the neck by a cross-bar, and fastened <i>in situ</i> by
straps cut from a raw hide; thus the slave, in order to be able to
walk, is forced to take the tree in his hands, and carry it before
him. No individual could, however, bear this position for any
length of time; to relieve each other, therefore, the man in front
takes the log of his successor on his shoulder, and this measure is
repeated in succession. It amounts to an impossibility to withdraw
the head, but the whole neck is always excoriated, an injury
leading often to inflammatory action, which occasionally terminates
in death. Boys from ten to fifteen years of age, who could not
carry the sheba, are hand-cuffed together by wooden manacles. The
instruments are applied to the right hand of the one and the left
of the other, above the wrists, where they are fastened by straps;
they are somewhat excavated to admit the hand, but
generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span> fit so
closely that the skin is excoriated, and malignant ulcers are the
result; but even if the hand were to mortify, or drop off, no
alleviation of the sufferings of the individual would ensue, for
the fetters are not taken off before the arrival of the convoy at
Lobeid. Some of the boys are fastened together in couples by straps
applied round the upper part of their arms. It may, therefore,
easily be imagined how difficult progression is rendered to these
poor sufferers, and what tortures they have to endure on this
march. In addition to these trials, they have to bear with most
miserable fare, and further ill-treatment, should their strength
fail them, or should they become too weak to proceed. Children
under the age before-mentioned, women, and old men, are marched
singly, and unfettered. Many a mother carries her infant, born but
a few days before, at her breast, and must even take two or three
of her children, who may be too young or too weak to walk alone, in
her arms, or on her back. Old and infirm men who can scarcely creep
along with the aid of a stick, the sick, and the wounded, are taken
in the middle, between their daughters, wives, or relations, and
thus slowly dragged onwards, or even carried by turns. If one of
these unfortunate beings happen to remain behind the ranks, he is
immediately stimulated to increased activity by blows with the
butt-end of the musket, or flogged on with the whip. Should even
this encouragement fail, and when several of these poor<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> wretches cannot possibly
proceed any further, ten or twenty of them are bound by the hand
with a rope, the one end of which is attached to the saddle-bow of
a camel, and thus those who are half dead are dragged onwards; even
if one of them happen to sink no mercy is shown, but the fallen man
is trailed along the ground and not liberated, even should he
breathe his last, before his arrival at the stated place of rest.
Before the caravan halts there is no idea of offering any
refreshment whatever in the way of food to the exhausted; the
heartless Turk feels no compassion, knows no pity; even if a drop
of water might revive a weary wretch, none is given him—no, he may
perish from want.</p>

<p>When the caravan reaches the place of rest, those who have been
dragged along are liberated; whilst the dead and the exhausted are
thrown without mercy on the sand, and the latter left to their
fate. No prayers, no entreaties can soften the obdurate hearts of
their torturers. They do not even allow a wife to take leave of her
husband, or a child to press the parting kiss upon the lips of its
expiring parent. No one is permitted to approach these unfortunate
wretches,—they are given over to their fate. Not even as much as a
piece of bread, or a drop of water is left behind for them. The
discarded wretch is given up to his doom to linger out his
existence, add to which the misery of the full consciousness of
certain death. In six or fourteen days, the transport reaches
Lobeid, and it is no wonder,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_324">[324]</span> considering the inhuman treatment the
captives have had to endure, that on its arrival more than
one-tenth of the number is found wanting. No notice, however, is
taken of this frightful loss on the road, for it is government
property, and personal interest is not concerned.</p>

<p>In Lobeid the slaves remain together until all the transports
arrive, and then the distribution takes place. The men best adapted
for the purpose are drafted into the regiments as recruits, and the
remainder of the full-grown slaves are delivered over to the
troops, quartered in Kordofan, in liquidation of their arrears of
pay, at an estimate of three hundred piasters a head; younger
slaves are valued at various prices. The soldiers are compelled to
re-sell them to the merchants for ready money, or for money’s
worth; sometimes the slave dies of over-fatigue, or excess of
torture, or does not realize the full sum on account of his age or
infirmities, and then the soldier suffers the loss, who, moreover,
generally receives but half his pay, although he has had to wait
for several months, or more frequently a whole twelvemonth for this
portion of his arrears.</p>

<p>It is not an uncommon occurrence for a son to find his own
father, or a father his son, assigned to him, or for a brother to
become the possessor of his brother; but he is forced in defiance
of the feelings of nature to sell him, in order to share the
proceeds with a comrade who<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_325">[325]</span> is co-proprietor of the slave with him.
Officers and privates are obliged to receive these slaves at a
certain valuation in lieu of money, and generally sell them at a
loss to the Djelabi. The remainder is disposed of by public
auction, in the market-place, to the highest bidder.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span><a id=
"c17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<span class="med">DESCRIPTION OF A SLAVE-HUNT IN THE YEARS 1838 AND
1839.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Towards</span> the end of the year 1838 the
Viceroy commanded the province of Kordofan to contribute five
thousand slaves. The corps under orders for this purpose,
consisting of two thousand four hundred infantry, seven hundred and
fifty Mogghrebeen (Bedouin horsemen), two hundred men irregular
cavalry, three hundred dromedary riders, and twelve hundred natives
armed with spear and shield, and attended by three guns, set out
upon the march towards the close of the month of November 1838. On
this occasion every two men of infantry were furnished with one
camel, as they could not collect the complement very soon, and an
immense number was, moreover, required for the transport of the
baggage, water, tents, etc., for the troops. Provisions and forage
for the cattle, both for service and for slaughter, were only added
to the transport sufficient for a few days, for they hoped to be
able to obtain the necessary supply in a short time by plunder and
pillage. A hill, one of the nearest on the borders of the free
Nuba, which had already<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_327">[327]</span> suffered by the troops of Mehemed Ali, and
by the marauding Bakkara, and, was in consequence greatly
depopulated, was the first challenged to surrender. The sheikh
instantly came into camp and delivered himself with all his
subjects, consisting of one hundred and ninety-six souls, into the
hands of the Turks; he received his liberty and a present of a
dress, but the sheba was put on the young men, and the whole number
forwarded on the next day to Lobeid. This sheikh himself told me
that when the Turks first entered his village eighteen years
before, the population consisted of three thousand souls, but the
annual contribution of slaves, augmented by the insatiable Turks to
ten times the number, had reduced them to one hundred and
ninety-six souls. The prisoners of this hill were treated with some
humanity, and not one instance of suicide took place among them,
for they had seen the futility of resistance, and voluntarily
surrendered to their dismal fate. The troops, however, were now in
want of bread, and as they found but a very slight supply of dockn
among this impoverished people, they were necessitated to advance.
The next hill was attacked, but how were the soldiers disappointed
in their expectations when they found the place evacuated! The
inhabitants, apprized of the approach of the corps, had fled,
taking all their property and cattle away with them, and had left
nothing but the empty huts, which were instantly fired and burnt to
the ground. And now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
the march was continued to the third hill. The inhabitants of this
village had formed the firm resolution of defending their freedom
to the uttermost; and, determined to suffer death rather than the
horror of Turkish captivity, had prepared for a most obstinate
resistance. The hill was charged, but the troops were several times
repulsed; the attacks, however, were renewed, and the village was
ultimately taken by storm. The scene which now presented itself to
view was frightful in the extreme. Of five hundred souls who had
been the peaceful inhabitants of the village, one hundred and
eighty-eight only were found living. Every hut was filled with the
bodies of the aged and the young indiscriminately, for those who
had not fallen by the sword in battle, had put themselves to death
to elude the dreadful fate of captivity. The prisoners were led
away; and the place was given up to the soldiery for plunder, but
the dead were left disinterred. What a fearful scene for the few
who were fortunate enough to escape the carnage by flight! Nothing
but the dead bodies of their friends and the ashes of their homes
met their eye on their return!</p>

<p>In order to recruit the troops, a camp was now formed, and a
detachment sent out in search of forage. An encampment of this
description, which is always erected on the plains, consists of an
irregular quadrangle, surrounded by a hedge of thorns or bushes, or
sometimes even by a stone fence, in which the regular infantry, the
guns, and baggage are enclosed,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_329">[329]</span> whilst the cavalry and spear-bearers encamp
without the enclosure. Of setting outposts, or of other judicious
military movements they have no idea, but confine themselves merely
to preparations for defence in case of a surprise, as the negroes
frequently venture by night on an attack, which might prove very
destructive to the troops, considering their carelessness.
Generally speaking a camp is soon broken up, and this was the case
on the present occasion; for no sooner had the soldiers recovered
somewhat from their fatigues, and furnished a scanty supply of
provisions, than the tents were struck, and the march commanded for
the next hill destined for attack. The cavalry was sent about two
miles in advance to surround the hill. On its arrival, however, in
the vicinity of the village, it was suddenly surprised by the
inhabitants, who had received intelligence of the movements, of the
troops and was attacked with vigour. The negroes in a very large
body, and only armed with spears and shields, broke with
impetuosity from their covert, and with a fearful war-cry,
augmented by the shouts of the women accompanying them, (resembling
the <em>Lu, lu, lu!</em> of the Arab women,) threw themselves
headlong upon the enemy. Surprised by this sudden movement, yet too
discreet to sustain the attack of the negroes, the cavalry turned
and took to flight. One of the Bedouin chiefs, who was mounted on a
restive horse, and could not keep up with his troop, was
surrounded; he seized his gun to discharge it at the first man who
might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span> attack him,
but it refused fire, and before he could make use of his pistols
and sabre, or put himself in any other way on his defence, he was
torn off his horse and instantly slain. None of his corps made the
slightest attempt to save their officer, for each man was intent on
his own escape. This flight must not be ascribed to cowardice on
the part of the Bedouins; for they generally fight well, provided
their interest is not at stake. By fraud, or promises destined
never to be fulfilled, these nomadic people are enticed away from
their native plains and employed in these frightful slave-hunts.
With the exception of very trifling pay, they can expect nothing
beyond what they may be able to gain themselves by robbery and
plunder; if by any chance, and without fault on their part, they
happen to lose a horse,—which is their personal property—even on
actual service, they cannot reckon upon any indemnification from
the government; for should they not have the means of purchasing a
fresh animal, they are indeed mounted by the government, but the
price of the horse is deducted from their pay, which is always on
the very lowest scale, and thus they have to serve for several
years gratuitously. Their sheikh, or commanding officer, told me
this himself, and assured me that his Bedouins, (erroneously termed
Mogghrebeen) would act very unwisely in risking their horses on an
attack whence nothing was to be gained; for the negroes, in
encountering cavalry, are well aware of the advantage of injuring
the horse rather than<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_331">[331]</span> the rider, as the latter falls a certain
victim to them when the animal is slain. After the cavalry had
again formed in the rear of the infantry, the officer in command
ordered a charge by the foot for the following day. If the attack
had succeeded, the carnage would, indeed, have been terrific, for
the troops were all eager to revenge the death of the Bedouin
sheikh. But it was differently recorded in the book of fate. With
the first dawn of morning the infantry were put in marching order
for the ensuing storm, and the cavalry placed in reserve. The
advance was now made, on the word of command, with the utmost
caution, a few cannon balls having been first sent into the village
without effect. All remained perfectly quiet, until the
advanceguard of the storming party had reached the foot of the hill
and prepared for action, when the negroes suddenly broke forth
endeavouring to surround the enemy. The position of the Egyptians
became now very critical, for bent upon the capture of this hill,
they had overlooked two other villages flanking the one attacked,
which were densely populated by negroes, who joined the besieged,
and threw themselves with the whole strength of their united forces
upon the troops. Not one man would have escaped, for enclosed in a
narrow valley, and surrounded by hills, the infantry could scarcely
move, and no assistance could be expected from the cavalry. The
whole brigade, in fact, would have been lost, as the negroes
gathered like a black cloud upon the hills,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_332">[332]</span> and poured down by hundreds upon the
enemy; no troops could withstand their attack, for they rushed into
battle with unparalleled frenzy, regardless of shot or bayonet, and
used their spears with great dexterity. The commander of the
Egyptian forces, however, betimes recognized the danger threatening
his troops, and ordered a retreat; when the whole body fled in wild
confusion from the vale of death. The cavalry was not behindhand in
this movement, and thus the brigade never halted until it was
fairly out of the dominions of the foe. Of a renewal of the attack
there was now no idea; for nothing in the world can induce these
heroes to repeat an advance where they have once been beaten. They
know further that the negroes become almost invincible with
success; while the musket and bayonet afford but slight advantage
over the weapons of the blacks, for the wild inhabitants of the
hills rush blindly to the charge, heedless of every wound. I myself
had opportunities of convincing myself of the intrepidity of these
men.</p>

<p>After the troops had again collected, order was once more
restored, and the march was continued; in the course of a few days
several hills were taken, and the prisoners duly forwarded to
Lobeid. The expedition now moved in a southern direction from the
Nuba mountains, towards a country inhabited by a different race of
men. The tribe now attacked differs from the natives of Nuba, both
in language and manners; they are easily recognized by the
number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> of brass
ear-rings, which they do not pass through the appendix of the ear,
but wear in the upper part of the cartilage, by which means the
whole ear is distorted, so that the superior portion covers the
meatus. Almost all the men wear the tooth of some animal, one inch
and a half to two inches in length, above their chin; it is passed
through a hole in the under lip when they are very young, and
acquires a firm adhesion with the integument. In their habits they
differ but little from the other negro tribes, but it is rather
remarkable that they do not, like the negroes, Turks, or Arabs,
convey food to their mouths with their fingers, but make use of a
shell, or piece of wood, shaped like a spoon, for this purpose. The
dwelling place of this tribe was very advantageously situated on
the summit of a hill, and very difficult of access; the commanding
officer, therefore, on hearing that it was not supplied with water,
to avoid a loss, decided upon surrounding the hill, and forcing the
negroes by thirst to surrender. The siege lasted eight days, and
the poor creatures, who felt themselves too weak for a
<i>sortie</i>, had not a drop of water left on the fourth day, as
was subsequently heard. The cattle was slain in the early part of
the blockade to diminish the consumption of water; on the sixth
day, several children and old people had perished of thirst; and on
the seventh day the mortality became so frightful, that they
determined to surrender. Several of them advised a sally, but
exhausted as they were, they<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_334">[334]</span> saw the futility of this movement; and
when, on the eighth day, hundreds had fallen in the most fearful
torments of unsatisfied thirst, and many of the negroes, in the
horrors of despair, had put an end to their miseries by ripping
open their abdomina with their double-edged knives, the small body
of survivors delivered itself up to the enemy. Of more than two
thousand souls, one thousand and forty-nine were only found living,
the rest had all perished by thirst, or had committed suicide. On
entering the village, the huts were seen filled with the dead, and
the few unfortunate survivors were so exhausted by fatigue, and
overpowered by thirst, that they could scarcely stand upon their
feet; yet with blows with the butt-end of the musket, or with the
whip, these poor wretches were driven from the huts, dragged into
camp, with every description of cruelty, and thence despatched for
Lobeid, on which march more than one hundred and fifty souls
perished from ill-usage.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of the march of this transport, after the
caravan had halted, and whilst the prisoners were forming
detachments to take up their quarters for the night, it so happened
that an aged woman, worn out with the fatigues of the long march,
or overcome by the mental sufferings she had endured, was incapable
of reaching the spot assigned to her with sufficient alacrity, and
a barbarous Turk dealt her a blow with the butt end of his musket,
which laid her nearly lifeless on the sand. Her<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> son, who witnessed this
gratuitous act of cruelty, no longer master of his feelings, rushed
with fury towards the soldier, struck him a blow with the sheba
round his neck, and felled him to the ground. This was the signal
for attack; all the slaves, who bore a sheba, threw themselves upon
the troops, and knocked them down, before they could take to their
arms, or fix their bayonets; thus fifty-six negroes took to flight
during the confusion in the camp, and aided by the darkness of
night, succeeded in effecting their escape. The natives, attached
to this transport, remained quiet spectators of the fray, a proof
of the interest they feel in these sanguinary hunts.</p>

<p>The body of the expedition had, in the meantime, continued its
march and taken another hill by storm,—but not without loss. This
village was situated on a steep declivity, accessible only on the
one side, and so well supplied with water that a blockade was out
of the question. A storm was, therefore, commanded. On both sides,
the men fought with desperate bravery. The storming party purchased
dearly with their blood every inch of ground they advanced. The
negroes had barricaded every accessible spot; each tree and every
stone formed an ambush whence they rushed forth upon their enemies,
who were scaling the heights under severe difficulties. The muskets
were of no avail, for the soldiers were forced to creep upon their
hands and feet and could not use their arms; thus, many
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> stabbed by the
spears of the natives, before they could rise on their feet, and,
in their fall, tore several of their advancing comrades down with
them into the precipice and ravines below. The cannonade employed
against the village was ineffective, and forced to be silenced to
avoid injuring their own men. The struggle was fearful, and the
event for some time doubtful, the soldiers, however, at last
succeeded in obtaining a footing on the heights, and were able to
employ their arms; the bayonet now decided the victory in their
favour, and the village was soon taken, in spite of the most
obstinate resistance on the part of the negroes. The havoc became
frightful: everyone who offered the slightest resistance was cut
down, children, women, and old men were put to the bayonet, the
huts were fired, and the whole place was pillaged; in short, every
species of cruelty was perpetrated on these ill-fated victims.
Those who fell into the hands of the victorious enemy were
immediately dragged down into the camp; whilst those who
endeavoured to escape, by concealing themselves in caverns and
ravines, were either hunted out by fire and smoke, or suffocated in
their place of shelter; every description of atrocity was
practised, nor did the carnage cease until the very last man of
this ill-starred tribe was exterminated or led away in captivity.
All the inconsiderable property of the natives which the troops
could not carry away with them as plunder was destroyed, and the
whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span> village
sacked and levelled with the ground. These were not all the
sufferings which fell to the lot of these unfortunate men, for
severer tortures awaited them during their march to Kordofan. I was
unfortunately, during some few days, an eye-witness of the misery
these poor prisoners endured. No pen can describe the cruelties
these miserable men were made to suffer, in addition to the mental
torment consequent on their loss of freedom; for laden with the
heavy sheba round their necks, or bound together with tight straps
or handcuffs, the poor negroes were driven on like cattle, but
treated with far less care or forbearance. The greater number of
them, covered with the wounds they had received in battle, or
excoriated by the sheba, or the straps, and handcuffs, were put to
yet severer trials on the road, and, if too exhausted to keep pace
with the transport, the most cruel punishment awaited them; the
piercing cry of complaint of these unfortunate beings, and the
tears and sobs of the children who had either lost their parents in
the capture of the village, or were too tired to follow their
exhausted mothers, would have melted a heart of stone to pity. On
these ruthless executioners, however, even this scene of misery
produces no effect; they march with unconcern by the side of the
prisoners, and are only anxious to further the progress of the
convoy, by urging on those who may be so weak that they cannot
follow the rest with blows and stripes. As they dragged
everyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span> away with
them whom they found living, there was, of course, a large number
of lame, blind, and old men, and persons afflicted with other
infirmities, among the complement of slaves, who were sure to
perish on the road, or who would be of no value on their arrival in
Lobeid. But, even this circumstance was not deemed worthy of
consideration; without mercy all were driven from their homes, and
delivered up to their fate; for the sole object is, to furnish the
number of slaves demanded by the government. Every morning, at
about ten o’clock, a halt was ordered, whereupon the prisoners were
formed according to their age into divisions, to receive their
rations, consisting of boiled dokn. Salt was out of the question,
and the dokn so hard that the full-grown men experienced difficulty
in masticating it. Children, who are too weak in the jaw to reduce
the grain, swallow it as they would pills, and are frequently put
to the most excruciating agony in consequence; for, not being able
to digest the food, their bodies swell, and they suffer from
flatulence and spasm. I have seen mothers chewing the victuals for
their children, and then offering it to them. In forming these
detachments according to age, children who anxiously cling to their
parents are torn by force from their arms, that they may eat alone.
The condition of sick and wounded was not considered; their wounds
were not even dressed, and they received the same allowance; many
of them threw themselves on the sand, and, refusing<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span> all food, preferred to rest
their weary limbs. When one of these poor wretches was so
debilitated that it became a matter of doubt whether he could be
dragged on any further, or when he was drawing his last breath, he
was thrown, like a piece of wood, aside, either to languish in
despair, or to be torn to pieces by the wild beasts. Bread is
unheard of on these marches, although they have every convenience
for baking; this would be too great a luxury, however, for the poor
slaves, who must content themselves with food not even good enough
for cattle.</p>

<p>As soon as the signal for the march was given, the slaves were
forced to join their detachments, and, in case of delay for one
minute only, the whip and butt-end of the musket were again at
work. Old men and infirm women, bent down with the weight of years
and care, who could scarcely creep along, suffered like treatment,
and when too weak to move on were left to perish on the sand.
Children were not allowed to take leave of their nearest relatives;
a tear and a look of sorrow was the only tribute they could pay to
the unfortunate beings delivered over to their doom. To prevent a
father or a mother from perishing in this miserable manner, their
wives or daughters, who were unfettered, would take one of these
wretches between two of them, who, passing his arms round the neck
of both, was thus dragged on, or even at times carried. Children
above six years of age, or even<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_340">[340]</span> at the age of four, were forced to walk;
they also generally succumb to the fatigues of the march, and are
then carried by their mothers or sisters. I have seen a mother with
an infant on one arm, and a child of two years of age on the other,
at last charge herself with a grown boy on her back, until she sank
herself exhausted under this triple load.</p>

<p>The officers commanding on these expeditions are more especially
to blame for the cruelty of the troops, for, riding at a distance
in front, or in the rear of the transport, they do not trouble
themselves about the condition of their prisoners, but leave them
entirely to the mercy of a ruthless soldiery. If an officer of more
feeling should happen to be in command, the circumstance is
instantly known by the diminished mortality on the road. I once met
with one of them who feelingly attended to the children and the
sick; who ordered them to be mounted on the beasts of burden when
too weak to proceed, and I saw him even take one or even two of the
children on his own horse. This man may lay his head on his pillow
in peace, free from the reproach of having augmented the sufferings
of his unfortunate fellow-creatures, whilst many of his comrades
must quail under the pangs of a guilty conscience for the fearful
death of hundreds of human beings.</p>

<p>An hour before sunset a halt was again ordered, and rations of
boiled dokn were once more served.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_341">[341]</span> But in the night the misery of the slaves
reached its very climax. In the month of January, when the changes
of temperature are ordinarily very perceptible, and the thermometer
generally falls below 4° Reaumur (41° Fahrenheit), the cold is felt
as severely as when at 4° or 5° below 0° of Reaumur (23° to 20, 75°
Fahrenheit), in the northern parts of Germany. Imagine, now, the
poor negroes in a state of absolute nudity, without the means of
covering themselves, and debilitated by hunger and fatigue, when
some idea may be formed of the sufferings they had to endure; fires
were certainly lighted, but the scanty supply of wood rendered it
impossible to defend these poor wretches from the effects of cold.
The shrieks and sobs of the children, the cries of the wounded, and
the groans of the sick, were perfectly horrifying, and in the
morning an infant was once found dead and stiff with the cold at
its mother’s breast. It is true that the negroes have no covering
in their own villages beyond a girdle or a piece of linen passed
round their loins, but then they lie at night in their huts, or
cover themselves with the skins of animals, none of which they can
find on their march. Those who wore the sheba could not sleep at
night for pain, as it so severely compresses the neck that it
impedes every movement, and thus not one man was free from
suffering. A woman far advanced in pregnancy was delivered in the
night without assistance. I gave the poor mother a shirt, in
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span> she wrapped
her infant, and thus safely carried it to Lobeid, and in compassion
for her weak state I lent her my ass to ride. I am unequal to the
task of narrating all the horrors I witnessed during the few days I
attached myself to the convoy; no words are sufficiently expressive
to describe the sufferings of the slaves, and no tongue can tell
the painful sensations of a man of feeling who witnesses these
atrocities. I did all in my power, with entreaties and presents, to
make the troops, and the irregular natives forming the escort, more
compassionate, and thus many a man was induced to take a child who
could not move its jaded feet along the burning sand upon his back,
or to relieve a mother exhausted by its weight, and carry it during
the whole of the day. Unfortunately, however, I was not able to put
a stop to all acts of cruelty, and was forced on one occasion to
see an unfeeling soldier fell a man to the ground with the butt-end
of his musket because unable to keep pace with the rest: his feet,
in fact, refused their office: he had been wounded in that part
during the siege, the wound had inflamed, and the pain had quite
overpowered him. I lost all command of my feelings on witnessing
this brutal act, drew my sword, and should have cut down the
inhuman barbarian, if my servant had not seized my arm and wrested
my sword and pistols from my hand; nor did he return my arms to me
before he saw that my passion had cooled. On the eighth day the
expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span> arrived
at Lobeid. The distribution, described in the former chapter, now
took place, and this is, properly speaking, the chief cause of the
harsh and merciless behaviour of the soldiery towards the slaves;
for they know, that they will be compelled to receive them in
liquidation of their arrears of pay, at a value far above the price
they will obtain from the slave-merchants; that the slaves,
moreover, frequently die before they can dispose of them, in which
case the loss falls upon them, and they must serve the government
for months gratuitously. Hence they do all in their power to rid
themselves of the old and infirm slaves before they reach Lobeid,
in order to avoid the inconvenience of being forced to take one of
these men in lieu of their pay. If the payment of the troops in the
Belled-Soodan were effected in cash, as it is in the other
provinces, I am convinced that the unfortunate slaves would meet
with more humane treatment. But thanks to the noble Queen Victoria
of England, whose eye of compassion has penetrated into these
distant realms, and cheered the hearts of the dejected and
oppressed inhabitants,—at whose earnest representations, in fine,
these slave-hunts have been put an end to by Mehemed Ali
himself,—thousands of these poor negroes, who from year to year
trembled under the fear of a similar fate, may now live in peace
and tranquillity; and the prayers of the emancipated, offered up to
the throne of the Almightly for this truly great monarch
cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span> fail to
reward her humanity by a prosperous and happy reign. According to
reports from Kordofan, no expedition for kidnapping slaves was
ordered in the year 1839, and the troops were paid in cash; but
those, unfortunately, of 1840 and 1841 sound very differently, for
Mehemed Ali, in spite of his solemn promise to put an end to all
further slave-hunts, had again commenced these revolting
expeditions.</p>

BANDANIANIAM.<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a></span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">During</span> my residence in Kordofan, I
enjoyed the opportunity of coming in contact with persons who had
travelled over the greater part of the South-east and South-west of
Africa, and who were able to give me information on many points
hitherto subjected to doubt. These were in part Djelabi
(merchants), in part Takruri (pilgrims). My chief object in making
these inquiries, was to obtain an authentic account of the course
of the White Nile, but I was unable to gain satisfactory
information for a length of time, and nearly despaired of ever
arriving at my end; for the men who travelled in the countries
through which this river flows, were<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_346">[346]</span> partly too deeply engaged in their own
business to attend to matters of little or no importance to them,
or were such from whose statements no certain conclusions could be
deduced. At last, however, I became acquainted with a negro from
Runga, who had spent three years of his life in Europe, and then
returned to his native country. A lengthened intercourse with this
man convinced me that he had enjoyed the opportunity of learning
more than his countrymen, and had profited by it, and was,
moreover, not addicted to falsehood, as the natives are, almost
without exception. He had visited his fatherland after three years
of absence, and had made various journeys into other countries. I
thought, therefore, that he would be the best man to apply to for
information on the course of the White Nile; I found him both
intelligent and willing, and obtained the following description,
which appears to me most worthy of credence:—</p>

<p>The Bahr-Abiad, or White Nile, flows through Runga, a country
situated to the south of Darfour, to which kingdom it is tributary.
The river is said to be very broad, but by no means deep, and even
fordable by men or cattle. During the dry season, it is not
navigable throughout, for in certain spots there is not enough
water to float a boat, and the natives are only in few places
provided with rafts. From Runga its course is directed towards
Bakkara, then towards the country of the Jenky, Dynke,
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span> Denkani, where
it is said to receive a tributary stream, of whose course I could
obtain no further information. After flowing through the country of
the Jenky and Shilluks, the Bahr-Abiad is said to enter Sennaar,
where it unites with the Blue Nile, near Khartoom. As I was more
anxious to know the course of the river before it reaches Runga, my
friend, the negro, introduced me to several of his acquaintances,
natives of those countries, which are watered by this stream, and
from this source I learnt that it flows through Binga, Wuanga,
Gulla, and Banda. I conversed with two or three persons on this
subject, two of them natives of Bornu, and the third a native of
Binga, who had resided during five years in the former state, and
they all coincided in that statement, that a river flows through
the country, named in their language the Gazelle-stream, because
its water is as pure and transparent as that of springs. They could
not tell me its source; but all agreed that it takes its course
towards Banda, where it is named the White River, from the colour
it assumes, dependent on the nature of the soil through which it
flows. I also received intelligence of certain Egyptian
antiquities, standing in the desert, between Kordofan and Darfour,
at Cab-Belull,<a id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class=
"fnanchor">[90]</a> a place situated at a distance of two days’
march from Caccie, on the borders of Kordofan. Doum-palms grow by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span> side of the
ruins, and in the dry season water is to be found at a distance of
eight miles from the spot. This place is very little known in
Kordofan even, for no road passes through the neighbourhood. My
informant was a Djelabi (merchant), who, on his return from
Darfour, had been compelled to make a considerable circuit to avoid
a horde of robbers, and had encamped at Cab-Belull. His
camel-drivers, who were Kubbabeesh, were acquainted with this spot,
and had frequently, on their former journeys, driven their beasts
to this place for pasture. I conclude the ruins to be Egyptian
antiquities, as the merchant compared them with those at Luxor,
with which he was also acquainted. They are said to consist of
large portals, and high walls; some few colossal figures in stone
are also reported to be there met with, but the greater part of
them is buried in the sands. The Djelabi brought a few
camel-drivers to me, who had a knowledge of that neighbourhood, for
I had made up my mind to visit the place, but unforeseen
circumstances subsequently prevented me from carrying this design
into effect.</p>

<p>On the hills, in the neighbourhood of Banda, a race of people
dwell, quite uncivilized in manner, warlike and predatory in habit:
the enemy, and even the terror, of all the bordering negro tribes.
They are of a white complexion, like the Arabs in Egypt, of regular
feature, well-grown, and have large blue eyes. They are called by
the negroes, Bandanianiam<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_349">[349]</span> (<i>Anthropophagi</i>), and are said to be
of Jewish extraction. The Sultan of Banda institutes hunts to
kidnap the girls of this tribe, and Sultan Mohammed Fadel, of
Darfour, has a few of them in his harem.</p>

"#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Kugo, and Niero; and
further, the small, but independent states of Berti, Domurky,
Birget, Gimmer, Fellata, Forga, and Bandala. Gimir, Sachaua, Bego,
Yambusa, Dama, Masalit, and Midol, are small republics, which
formerly had no superiors beyond a magistrate, or sheikh, in each
village, who exerted no executive power, but was obeyed as the head
of a family.</p>

<p>All these states were subjected to Darfour by force of arms.
Their respective sultans inherit the right of throne as heretofore,
but are now tributaries to that country; the contribution
consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span> of ivory,
rhinoceros’ horns, white copper, gold, and slaves. The seraskier,
or general, who resides at Shata or Deleb, is forced to levy the
tribute; and detachments of troops are continually on foot in the
various districts, engaged in collecting the taxation, for which
purpose they are always obliged to resort to coercive measures. The
army consists of irregular troops armed with shield and spear, and
some few with bows and arrows. The cavalry are provided with very
hardy horses, and armed with double-edged sabres, which they obtain
from Germany; they are, in part, clad like the old Numidian horse
in shirts of mail, purchased at large sums in Arabia; so high,
indeed, is the price of this armour, that it might be manufactured
in Germany at one fourth of the cost. There are only about four
hundred muskets, of various shapes and sizes, in the whole army;
their balls they cast of copper. At El Fasher, the capital of
Darfour, four iron cannons are mounted. Dar-Marra, a large hill,
situated at a distance of two short days’ journey from El Fasher,
is considered the fort of Darfour, and is believed to be
impregnable, as it has a never-failing supply of water, and if
besieged, might grow sufficient corn for the consumption of the
garrison. The army of Darfour, has, at various times, ventured as
far as Banda,<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a> Wuanga, and Pegu, but was always beaten back
with considerable loss. Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_353">[353]</span> Fadel, Sultan of Darfour, is the present
despotic monarch reigning over all these countries; he is an
exceedingly barbarous man, greatly dreaded by all his subjects, and
has merely kept himself in power by his considerable irregular
army. His younger brothers, Abumedina and Achmet, who are both
beloved by the people, he, on that account, bitterly hates, and
consequently treats them more harshly than slaves. When his
oppressive cruelty became too severe to be endured, they
determined, with the aid of a few trustworthy friends, to effect
their escape to Kordofan, their flight was, however, discovered,
and Sultan Fadel had them pursued; they were overtaken on the
borders of Kordofan, and the youngest was, after some slight
resistance, seized and carried before his brother Fadel, who
instantly had his eyes put out. A fleet horse saved Abumedina, and
he reached Kordofan, after having received a severe sabre wound
across his head in his defence; he now placed himself under the
protection of Mehemed Ali, who instantly made him a monthly
allowance. On his last journey to the gold-mines of Fazoglo, in
Sennaar, Mehemed Ali summoned Abumedina into his presence, and
promised to place him on the throne of Darfour, as soon as his own
affairs with the Porte were settled; for which kind office
Abumedina is to pay an annual tribute to Egypt of a thousand
horses, ivory, and white copper; the exact quantity of the latter
articles was not determined, but he is to keep the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> Egyptian auxiliaries in his
pay as long as he may deem their services necessary.</p>

<p>Should his wishes of rising to the throne of Darfûr be
fulfilled, as he confidently hopes, Europeans would gain
considerably by this change in the government, for it would open a
new path into the unexplored portions of Central Africa; and much
good may be, moreover, expected from his very excellent character.
He has often told me himself, that he would receive an European,
who would occupy himself with the civilization of his people, with
open arms.<a id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The following short anecdote may serve as a proof of the
kindness of his disposition, and of the nobleness of his
character.</p>

<p>During my sojourn in Lobeid, I had the opportunity of an
introduction to Abumedina: he received my visit with great kindness
and attention, and I passed for a considerable time some hours
daily in his company.<a id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Among my effects there happened to be a
gun in the form of a walking-stick,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_355">[355]</span> which Abumedina very much wished to
possess, when he learned the use of it. At his request, but rather
as a mark of my esteem, I gave it to him, with instructions as to
the treatment of it, in loading, &amp;c., and I more especially
drew his attention to the quantity of powder necessary for the
charge. A short time after this, Abumedina went out shooting, at
his country-seat, and overcharged the gun, which of course burst
and in the explosion very much shattered his left hand. His
attendants laid the blame of this accident upon me, and requested
the sultan to punish me for it. Apprehensive of the consequences, I
fled, and concealed myself in the house of a fakeér, who was my
friend, and from whom I had no treachery to fear. I there heard
that the Divan at Lobeid had instituted proceedings at law against
me, but that Abumedina had taken my defence upon himself, and torn
the papers, saying, “Pallme is my friend! he cautioned me; he is
innocent; it was the will of God.” After passing ten days in a dark
and damp straw hut, in the greatest anxiety, I preferred continuing
my flight, although I had nothing further to fear from Abumedina. I
consequently proceeded straightway to the White Nile, and thence to
Sennaar, whence I travelled over Berber, and the desert, to Egypt.
By the time I had passed the first cataract, all my cares were
dissipated, and I was walking one day on the banks of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span> the Nile, at Sijuth, when I
suddenly heard a negro calling me by my name, at a short distance
from me. I turned round, and immediately recognized Abumedina’s
eunuch. This rencontre appeared to me, at the moment, rather
suspicious; I quickened my pace, therefore, towards my boat, to
reach my arms, and defend myself, if necessary; nor could the
eunuch induce me to follow him; but then came one of the Sultan’s
mamelukes, in whom I could place more confidence; I consequently
accompanied him to the boat belonging to the prince, where I was
most cordially welcomed. The Sultan had all my luggage removed to
his boat, and I travelled in his company to Cairo, where he waits
for the twelve thousand men, which Mehemed Ali has promised to lend
him, for the purpose of conquering Darfour,<a id=
"FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
as soon as circumstances will permit him to spare as many
troops.</p>

idiots. They are unfortunate beings, who, although neglected by
nature, are considered in this country as direct apostles from God,
to inform the children of man of their destiny. These poor wretches
are all but idolized, every one being anxious to shew them the
utmost respect. When they walk out in the streets, they are stopped
by old and young, who kiss their face, hands, and even their feet,
and offer them everything they wish for. Beings of this description
are generally very apathetic, and accept little or nothing; they
are, in fact, generally to be met dressed in the most disgusting
clothes, in rags, or utterly naked, although they would be provided
with the finest raiment if they merely expressed the slightest
wish. Their parents, sisters, or other relations, on the other
hand, know how to turn their misfortune to the best account, and
accept considerable presents for their intercession with these
saints, or for procuring others an opportunity of consulting this
oracle. They give the most absurd and ridiculous answers to
questions that are put to them, partly as a consequence of their
fatuity, and partly because taught to do so; it is, indeed,
scarcely possible at times to guess at their meaning. The more
absurd the answer, the more contented is the party interested; and
absolutely delighted, if he can only make out a single word of the
whole rodomontade, which in the slightest agrees with his wishes.
To these saints the women flock in numbers to beg for fertility.
Besides these Sheikhs, there are others, and Fakéers, who write
amulets, which the women wear on their arms, or heads, firmly
believing that their most fervent wishes will be then fulfilled.
The latter profession is exceedingly lucrative, and I have seen
several persons who had made a small fortune in this manner, and
very well understood the art of imposing on the people, and of
persuading them to purchase a fresh charm, although experience must
have convinced them of the futility of the last.</p>

with the body of the matter of this and the following chapter at

totally at a loss for correct information on the slave-hunts
annually taking place in the provinces of the Pasha of Egypt. I was
the more willing to assist him in this undertaking, as it was the
intention of the Society to make representations to Mehemed Ali on
this subject, and thus to endeavour to save thousands of
unfortunate victims. This and the subsequent chapter have appeared

although somewhat irrelevant to the subject, as so little is yet
known of that kingdom, and the source of my information may be
considered very authentic; for I had it from no less a person than
Sultan Abumedina, the brother of the Sultan of Darfour, and I am,
moreover, of opinion that it will not be altogether useless in a
geographical point of view.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92"><span class=
"label">[92]</span></a>Runga is situated on a river, believed to be
the White Nile, and is said to be a fertile country, with a very
healthy climate. Bananas, wild grapes, lemons, and three sorts of
potatoes, grow in the country; the first is a small and curved
variety, which grows without cultivation in the sand; the second
variety resembles the European potatoe in shape and flavour, and is
planted; the third, which is also cultivated, is a giant potatoe,
said to attain the weight of twelve oock’ckahs, equal to
twenty-seven pounds. The country is supposed to be very rich in
silver ore, of which but little use is made, as the smelting costs
the natives too much trouble. Darfour draws a great deal of ivory
and rhinoceros’ horn from this country, but it has no camels.
Islamism has made great progress there within the last few years.
The religion of the natives is exceedingly simple; they believe in
the existence of an invisible deity who produces water, namely
rain, and makes their fruit to grow. They pay, further, great
respect to persons afflicted with fatuity, and believe them to be
prophets of the invisible God. They build peculiar huts for these
beings, more like birdcages than houses, where they are confined,
and provided with food. Before sunset the populace visits them to
consult them for advice, and every answer, be it ever so
nonsensical, is regarded as an oracle, and firmly believed. The
same ideas are said to prevail in Banda, Wuanga, Binga, and
Gulla.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93"><span class=

found, which is met with in commerce in Kordofan, and converted
into anklets for the women, weighing about one pound each; it has
not the same characteristics as the European copper, but bears a
nearer resemblance to brass; its colour is pale yellow.</p>

Darfour, but he would never return, because the reigning Sultan
looks upon every white man as a spy of Mehemed Ali’s. Mohammed
Fadel’s chief wish is to have some European settlers in his
country; he even invited me through a Djelabi, to come; for he is
well aware that Mehemed Ali has set his eye upon Darfour. An
European died eight years ago in that kingdom: he was a renegade,
and stood very high in the favour of the Court. He has left two
full-grown sons; but I could neither discover his name, nor the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
